SYSTEM:


        You are a Requirements Engineer specializing in domain modeling.
        I will provide you with a selection of user stories from a specific domain, along with a list of classes identified from these user stories. Your task is to determine the relevant associations among these classes, following the guidelines below.
        
        Step 1: Identify Potential Associations
        o Analyze the Provided Classes: Examine each pair (or group) of classes to see if there is a meaningful structural relationship between them, grounded in the user stories.
        o Domain Modeling Context: Only propose associations that directly reflect real-world interactions.
        o Ignore Association Names: Do not worry about naming each relationship; focus on identifying whether an association exists.
        

USER:


        Here is the list of user stories:
        As a moderator, I want to create a new game by entering a name and an optional description, so that I can start inviting estimators.
As a moderator, I want to invite estimators by giving them a URL where they can access the game, so that we can start the game.
As a moderator, I want to start a round by entering an item in a single multi-line text field, so that we can estimate it.
As a moderator, I want to see all items we try to estimate this round, so that I can answer questions about the current item such as "does this include ___".
As a moderator, I want to select an item to be estimated or re-estimated, so that the team sees that item and can estimate it.
As a moderator, I want to add an item to the list of items to be estimated, so that so that we can be flexible and accommodate situations where we think of a new item while playing.
As a moderator, I want to edit an item in the list of items to be estimated, so that I can make it better reflect the team's understanding of the item.
As a moderator, I want to delete an item from the list of items to be estimated, so that we can remove it and not estimate it.
As a moderator, I want to show all estimates immediately, so that I can decide to show the estimates that have been given even though not all estimators have given their estimate.
As a moderator, I want to accept the average of all estimates, so that we can move on to the next item when we agree.
As a moderator, I want to have the "estimate" field filled in automatically if all estimators show the same card, so that I can accept it more quickly.
As a moderator, I want to enter the agreed-upon estimate, so that we can move on to the next item when we agree.
As a moderator, I want to estimate a item we estimated earlier in the round again, so that we can give a new estimate if we feel different about the item after estimating other related items.

As a participant, I want to be shown all estimates at the same time after all estimators have given their estimate, so that I can be sure estimates are independent and not influenced by other estimates given in the same draw.
As a participant, I want to be able to change my estimate up until the last person selects a card and all are shown, so that I can change my mind based on information I hear.
As a participant, I want to be able to see each estimator's prior estimates for the item being estimated, so that I can see how his or her opinion has changed so I can ask questions.
As a participant, I want to see who gave what estimates during the current round, so that I know this when weÂre discussing the estimates.
As a participant, I want to be able start a two-minute countdown timer that all participants can see, so that I can limit the time spent discussing the estimates when I think weÂve talked long enough.
As a participant, I want to have the two-minute timer reset itself as soon as we all play an estimate, so that it's ready for use on the next round.
As a participant, I want to scroll back through the items and estimates from prior rounds, so that I can use this information when I estimate the item of the current round.
As a participant, I want to always have the cards in the same order across multiple draws, so that it's easy to compare estimates.
As a participant, I want to change my estimate as long as the draw has not been completed, so that I can change my mind.
As a participant, I want to have a small thumbnail photo displayed near where my cards are played, so that the game is more personal because I see who I'm estimating with.

As a user, I want to be able to use Unicode, so that I can use any language I like.
As a user, I want to see sensible and predictable URLs, so that the application feels logical and transparent.
As a user, I want to have nice error pages when something goes wrong, so that I can trust the system and its developers.

As a Mike, I want to be able to see some metrics on use of the game, so that I can see how much it is being used.
        
        Here is the list of classes identified from these user stories. Only create associations based on the classes shown in this list. Do not invent any other class.

USER:


        Based on the user stories and the list of potential associations you provided, refine the list by following Step 2.
        
        Step 2: Filter Out Unnecessary/Incorrect Associations
        Use the following criteria to remove or refine associations:
        o Irrelevant Associations: Remove any that do not fit the domain.
        o Implementation Associations: Exclude technical constructs.
        o Ternary Associations: Avoid or break down associations involving three or more classes.
        o Derived Associations: Remove any association that can be inferred from existing ones.
        If an association cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation.

USER:


        Step 3: Present the Associations in 'X-Y' Format
        For each valid association, present it in the format X-Y, where X and Y are the names of the associated classes. Each association should reflect a relationship that is clearly stated or reasonably implied in the user stories.
        If an association is ambiguous or uncertain, prefix it with (Optional) and do not try to reclassify it as valid yourself.
        
        Please follow the output format strictly:
        
        Here is the final list of associations:
        1. Class1-Class2

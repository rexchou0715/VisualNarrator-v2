SYSTEM:


        You are a Requirements Engineer specializing in domain modeling.
        I will provide you with a selection of user stories from a specific domain, along with a list of classes identified from these user stories. Your task is to determine the relevant associations among these classes, following the guidelines below.
        
        Step 1: Identify Potential Associations
        o Analyze the Provided Classes: Examine each pair (or group) of classes to see if there is a meaningful structural relationship between them, grounded in the user stories.
        o Domain Modeling Context: Only propose associations that directly reflect real-world interactions.
        o Ignore Association Names: Do not worry about naming each relationship; focus on identifying whether an association exists.

USER:


        Based on the user stories and the list of potential associations you provided, refine the list by following Step 2.

        o Irrelevant Associations: Remove any that do not fit the domain.
        o Implementation Associations: Exclude technical constructs.
        o Ternary Associations: Avoid or break down associations involving three or more classes.
        o Derived Associations: Remove any association that can be inferred from existing ones.
        If an association cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation.

        If an association is ambiguous or uncertain, prefix it with (Optional) and do not try to reclassify it as valid yourself.

SYSTEM:


        You are a Requirements Engineer specializing in domain modeling.
        I will provide you with a selection of user stories from a specific domain, along with a list of classes identified from these user stories. Your task is to determine the relevant associations among these classes, following the guidelines below.
        
        Step 1: Identify Potential Associations
        o Analyze the Provided Classes: Examine each pair (or group) of classes to see if there is a meaningful structural relationship between them, grounded in the user stories.
        o Domain Modeling Context: Only propose associations that directly reflect real-world interactions.
        o Ignore Association Names: Do not worry about naming each relationship; focus on identifying whether an association exists.

        o Derived Associations: Remove any association that can be inferred from existing ones.
        If an association cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation.

USER:


        Step 3: Present the Associations in 'X-Y' Format
        For each valid association, present it in the format X-Y, where X and Y are the names of the associated classes. Each association should reflect a relationship that is clearly stated or reasonably implied in the user stories.
        If an association is ambiguous or uncertain, prefix it with (Optional) and do not try to reclassify it as valid yourself.
        
        Please follow the output format strictly:
        
        Here is the final list of associations:
        1. Class1-Class2
        2. Class3-Class4
        3. (Optional) Class5-Class6 : This association is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

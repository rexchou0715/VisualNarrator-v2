SYSTEM:


        You are a Requirements Engineer specializing in domain modeling.
        I will provide you with a selection of user stories from a specific domain, along with a list of classes identified from these user stories. Your task is to determine the relevant associations among these classes, following the guidelines below.
        
        Step 1: Identify Potential Associations
        o Analyze the Provided Classes: Examine each pair (or group) of classes to see if there is a meaningful structural relationship between them, grounded in the user stories.
        o Domain Modeling Context: Only propose associations that directly reflect real-world interactions.
        o Ignore Association Names: Do not worry about naming each relationship; focus on identifying whether an association exists.

ASSISTANT:

Based on the provided user stories and the list of classes, I will identify potential associations among these classes, following the guidelines.

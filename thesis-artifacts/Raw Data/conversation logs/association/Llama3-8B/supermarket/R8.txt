SYSTEM:


        You are a Requirements Engineer specializing in domain modeling.
        I will provide you with a selection of user stories from a specific domain, along with a list of classes identified from these user stories. Your task is to determine the relevant associations among these classes, following the guidelines below.
        
        Step 1: Identify Potential Associations
        o Analyze the Provided Classes: Examine each pair (or group) of classes to see if there is a meaningful structural relationship between them, grounded in the user stories.
        o Domain Modeling Context: Only propose associations that directly reflect real-world interactions.
        o Ignore Association Names: Do not worry about naming each relationship; focus on identifying whether an association exists.

USER:


        Based on the user stories and the list of potential associations you provided, refine the list by following Step 2.
        
        Step 2: Filter Out Unnecessary/Incorrect Associations
        Use the following criteria to remove or refine associations:
        o Irrelevant Associations: Remove any that do not fit the domain.
        o Implementation Associations: Exclude technical constructs.
        o Ternary Associations: Avoid or break down associations involving three or more classes.
        o Derived Associations: Remove any association that can be inferred from existing ones.
        If an association cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation.

Removed associations:

* **Product - Recipes**: A recipe does not directly relate to a product, but rather to a product's ingredients and instructions. This association is better represented by an association between **Recipe** and **Product**.
* **Employee - Store**: An employee can work at multiple stores, so this association is better represented by a one-to-many relationship between **Employee** and **Store**.
* **Customer - Newsletter**: A customer can subscribe to multiple newsletters, so this association is better represented by a one-to-many relationship between **Customer** and **Newsletter**.
* **Store - Delivery**: This association is already included in **Store - Products** and **Product - Delivery**.
* **Employee - Order**: This association is already included in **Employee - Products** and **Product - Order**.
* **Ternary associations**: Associations involving three or more classes, such as **Order - Products - Employee**, have been removed or broken down into simpler associations.

Optional associations:

* **Customer - Personal Discount**: This association is inferred from **Customer - Order** and **Order - Personal Discount**.
* **Product - Personal Discount**: This association is inferred from **Product - Order** and **Order - Personal Discount**.

These refined associations reflect the most relevant and accurate relationships between the classes in the domain.

USER:


        Step 3: Present the Associations in 'X-Y' Format
        For each valid association, present it in the format X-Y, where X and Y are the names of the associated classes. Each association should reflect a relationship that is clearly stated or reasonably implied in the user stories.
        If an association is ambiguous or uncertain, prefix it with (Optional) and do not try to reclassify it as valid yourself.
        
        Please follow the output format strictly:
        
        Here is the final list of associations:
        1. Class1-Class2
        2. Class3-Class4
        3. (Optional) Class5-Class6 : This association is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

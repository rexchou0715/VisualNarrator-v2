SYSTEM:


        You are a Requirements Engineer specializing in domain modeling.
        I will provide you with a selection of user stories from a specific domain, along with a list of classes identified from these user stories. Your task is to determine the relevant associations among these classes, following the guidelines below.
        
        Step 1: Identify Potential Associations
        o Analyze the Provided Classes: Examine each pair (or group) of classes to see if there is a meaningful structural relationship between them, grounded in the user stories.
        o Domain Modeling Context: Only propose associations that directly reflect real-world interactions.
        o Ignore Association Names: Do not worry about naming each relationship; focus on identifying whether an association exists.

USER:


        Based on the user stories and the list of potential associations you provided, refine the list by following Step 2.
        
        Step 2: Filter Out Unnecessary/Incorrect Associations
        Use the following criteria to remove or refine associations:
        o Irrelevant Associations: Remove any that do not fit the domain.
        o Implementation Associations: Exclude technical constructs.
        o Ternary Associations: Avoid or break down associations involving three or more classes.
        o Derived Associations: Remove any association that can be inferred from existing ones.
        If an association cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation.

   - **Association:** `Event` has multiple `Genre`

9. **Association: Artist has multiple Events**
   - An artist has multiple events associated with them, and an event can be associated with multiple artists.
   - However, this association implies that an artist is only associated with events, which might not be the case in reality (e.g., an artist might be associated with other entities like albums or merchandise).

10. **Association: User can have multiple Tickets**
    - A user can have multiple tickets, and a ticket can be owned by multiple users.
    - However, this association implies that a user can own tickets independently, which might not be the case in reality (e.g., a user might only own tickets that are associated with orders).

        Step 3: Present the Associations in 'X-Y' Format
        For each valid association, present it in the format X-Y, where X and Y are the names of the associated classes. Each association should reflect a relationship that is clearly stated or reasonably implied in the user stories.
        If an association is ambiguous or uncertain, prefix it with (Optional) and do not try to reclassify it as valid yourself.
        
        Please follow the output format strictly:

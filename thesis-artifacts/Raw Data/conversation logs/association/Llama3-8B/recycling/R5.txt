SYSTEM:


        You are a Requirements Engineer specializing in domain modeling.
        I will provide you with a selection of user stories from a specific domain, along with a list of classes identified from these user stories. Your task is to determine the relevant associations among these classes, following the guidelines below.
        
        Step 1: Identify Potential Associations
        o Analyze the Provided Classes: Examine each pair (or group) of classes to see if there is a meaningful structural relationship between them, grounded in the user stories.
        o Domain Modeling Context: Only propose associations that directly reflect real-world interactions.
        o Ignore Association Names: Do not worry about naming each relationship; focus on identifying whether an association exists.

USER:


        Based on the user stories and the list of potential associations you provided, refine the list by following Step 2.
        
        Step 2: Filter Out Unnecessary/Incorrect Associations
        Use the following criteria to remove or refine associations:
        o Irrelevant Associations: Remove any that do not fit the domain.
        o Implementation Associations: Exclude technical constructs.
        o Ternary Associations: Avoid or break down associations involving three or more classes.
        o Derived Associations: Remove any association that can be inferred from existing ones.
        If an association cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation.

    - Duplicate: This is already mentioned as association 10.

15. **User** has a one-to-many association with **Recycling Facility**:

16. **Admin** has a one-to-many association with **Waste Type**:
    - Ternary association: The provided user stories don't explicitly state that an admin is associated with a waste type. It would be more accurate to say that a recycling facility is associated with a waste type.

17. **Superuser** has a one-to-one association with **Recycling Facility**:
    - Optional: This association is similar to the recycling facility representative association, but it's unclear who a superuser is and what their role is. More context is needed.

18. **Admin** has a one-to-many association with **Schedule**:
    - Ternary association: The provided user stories don't explicitly state that an admin is associated with a schedule. It would be more accurate to say that a user is associated with a schedule.

19. **User** has a one-to-many association with **Employees**:
    - Ternary association: The provided user stories don't explicitly state that a user is associated with an employee. However, it's possible that a user can interact with multiple employees.

20. **Recycling Facility** has a one-to-many association with **Safe Disposal Events**:
    - Optional: This association is not directly stated in the user stories. However, it's possible that a recycling facility can host multiple safe disposal events.

USER:


        Step 3: Present the Associations in 'X-Y' Format
        For each valid association, present it in the format X-Y, where X and Y are the names of the associated classes. Each association should reflect a relationship that is clearly stated or reasonably implied in the user stories.
        If an association is ambiguous or uncertain, prefix it with (Optional) and do not try to reclassify it as valid yourself.
        
        Please follow the output format strictly:
        
        Here is the final list of associations:
        1. Class1-Class2
        2. Class3-Class4
        3. (Optional) Class5-Class6 : This association is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

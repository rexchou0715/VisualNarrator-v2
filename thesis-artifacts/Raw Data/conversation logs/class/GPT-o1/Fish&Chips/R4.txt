User:

You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.

I will provide you with a set of user stories.

Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
	• Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
	• Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the “nouns or compound nouns” themselves.
3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like “thing,” “item,” or similarly vague words.
	

Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes

Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
   • Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
   • Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain or a very low frequency of appearance in the user stories.
   • Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
   • Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
   • Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
   • Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
   • Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
   • Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
	
If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included


Step 3: Present the Final Class List

1. Structured Format: Present the refined list of class candidates in a concise format, such as [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...].
2. Numbered Format: Additionally, present the same list in a numbered format for clarity, e.g.:
   1. Class 1  
   2. Class 2  
   3. Class 3  
3. Justify Retained Classes: Briefly explain the rationale for retaining each class, referencing the filtering rules (e.g., not too generic, not an attribute, not an operation).
4. Mark Optional Classes: For any noun that cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with **(optional)** and explain the ambiguity behind its inclusion.

## Step 1: Identify Potential Classes (All Nouns or Compound Nouns)

First, we extract **all** nouns (and compound nouns) from the user stories, *without* yet filtering them:

1. Kitchen Employee  
2. Orders / Order  
3. Status  
4. Progress  
5. Overview  
6. Products / Product  
7. Special Requests / Special Request  
8. Order Number  
9. Notification  
10. New Order  
11. Customer  
12. Changes  
13. Ticket Master  
14. Label  
15. Incoming Orders  
16. Current Orders  
17. Preparation  
18. Finished Orders  
19. Scheduled Orders  
20. Requested Time  
21. Ten Minutes  
22. Insight  
23. Day  
24. Focus  
25. Colors  
26. Touchscreen  
27. Screen  
28. Ticket  
29. Physical Ticket  
30. Relevant Information  
31. Misunderstanding  
32. Costs  
33. Own Administration  
34. Cashier  
35. Type of Order  
36. Delivery Person  
37. Pickup Time  
38. Takeaway Order  
39. Delivery Address  
40. Phone Number  
41. Customer’s Name  
42. Digital Ticket  
43. Payment Methods  
44. Tip  
45. Price of the Order  
46. Coupons / Coupon  
47. VAT  
48. Taxes  
49. Restaurant Owner  
50. Sold Products  
51. Inventory  
52. Daily Revenue  
53. Shift  
54. Employees  
55. Cashier Accounts  
56. Balance  
57. Expected Revenue  
58. Home Delivery Orders  
59. Home Delivery Person  
60. Navigation System  
61. Location  
62. Problems (delivering food)

Many of these are duplicates, near-duplicates, user-interface terms, attributes (rather than stand-alone entities), or simply roles or actions. Next, we apply the filtering rules.

## Step 2: Filter Out Unsuitable Classes

### 2.1 Remove Roles
Roles (Kitchen Employee, Ticket Master, Cashier, Restaurant Owner, Home Delivery Person, Delivery Person) are generally excluded if they merely denote *who* interacts with the system, rather than an intrinsic domain entity. The system may ultimately store an “Employee” or “User” entity with a role attribute, but each job title alone (“Kitchen Employee,” “Ticket Master,” etc.) is not kept as a separate class.

- **Kitchen Employee** → filtered out as a role  
- **Ticket Master** → filtered out as a role  
- **Cashier** → filtered out as a role  
- **Restaurant Owner** → filtered out as a role  
- **Home Delivery Person** → filtered out as a role  
- **Delivery Person** → filtered out as a role  

However, because we do repeatedly see employees having shifts, receiving tip distributions, etc., we can consider a single **Employee** class (see below).

### 2.2 Remove or Merge Attributes  
Terms that are clearly attributes of a larger entity (e.g., phone number, address) are not themselves domain classes.

- **Order Number** → attribute of an Order  
- **Delivery Address** → attribute of an Order (or a separate “Address” value object, but typically not a top-level class)  
- **Phone Number** → attribute of Customer or Order  
- **Pickup Time** → attribute of an Order  
- **Customer’s Name** → attribute of Customer  
- **Price of the Order** → attribute of Order  
- **VAT**, **Taxes** → attributes of Order or Payment  
- **Balance** → attribute of an Account (if we keep Accounts)  
- **Requested Time**, **Ten Minutes**, **Day** → typical date/time attributes, not classes  
- **Type of Order** (takeaway/delivery) → attribute of an Order  
- **Colors** (matching statuses) → attribute or UI detail (color coding)  
- **Shift** → possibly stored as an attribute or a smaller sub-entity for time tracking. (Marked *optional* below.)

### 2.3 Remove Generic or UI Concepts  
User-interface nouns such as “screen,” “touchscreen,” “overview,” “focus,” “progress (bar),” “navigation system” generally do not represent core business entities.

- **Overview** → a view or UI concept  
- **Screen / Touchscreen** → system/implementation concept  
- **Navigation System** → external tool used by the delivery person, not a domain entity  
- **Progress** → typically an attribute (e.g., part of an “Order status”)  
- **Insight / Focus** → intangible UI-related terms  

### 2.4 Remove Operations/Events  
Nouns that clearly represent an action or event rather than a persistent “thing” are excluded unless the domain specifically tracks them as separate entities.

- **Notification** → an event or message. Could be modeled if the system explicitly stores notifications. Marked *optional* below because it may or may not be a tracked entity.
- **Changes** → an action or process, not a thing  
- **Preparation** → a process (part of a Product or Order life cycle)  
- **Label** → an action of labeling orders, not a separate class  

### 2.5 Filter Out Redundancies / Variations of the Same Entity
- **Incoming Orders**, **Current Orders**, **Finished Orders**, **Scheduled Orders** → All are variations of *Order* with different statuses, so we keep a single **Order** entity.  
- **Home Delivery Orders** → still an Order, just a subtype or different attribute.

### 2.6 Identify Legitimate Domain Concepts

After filtering, the likely *genuine* domain concepts are:

1. **Order**  
   - Central concept repeated throughout the user stories.  
2. **Product**  
   - An Order is composed of one or many Products.  
3. **Special Request**  
   - User stories emphasize adding a “special request” to a product (e.g., “no onions,” “extra cheese”). This suggests it can be treated as an entity linked to Products or Orders.  
4. **Customer**  
   - The system must track customer information (and their orders).  
5. **Employee**  
   - General entity for all roles (kitchen, cashier, ticket master, etc.) if the system needs to store information about staff.  
6. **Ticket**  
   - Physical or digital “receipt” or “ticket,” frequently mentioned in user stories, including printing for the customer or the kitchen.  
7. **Coupon**  
   - Discounts or promotional codes are mentioned as something the cashier can “activate.”  
8. **Cashier Account**  
   - There is explicit mention of “I want to have cashier accounts to check their balance.” This suggests an account-based concept for financial tracking.  
9. **Inventory**  
   - The restaurant owner wants to see sold products to restock inventory. Indicates a domain concept for maintaining stock.  
10. **Payment**  
   - The user stories (cashier, customer) repeatedly refer to payment, tips, and payment confirmations. This may be a distinct entity (including the method, tip, etc.).

---

### Optional
- **Notification**: Could be an actual stored message entity or just a system event. Marked optional, since it is not 100% clear if the domain *persists* these notifications, or they are just ephemeral alerts.  
- **Shift**: The user stories reference checking balances at the end of a shift and distributing tips. Some teams treat “Shift” as an attribute (e.g., start/end timestamps) rather than a first-class entity. So it could go either way.  

---

## Step 3: Present the Final Class List


Here is the final list of classes:

1. **Order**  
2. **Product**  
3. **Special Request**  
4. **Customer**  
5. **Employee**  
6. **Ticket**  
7. **Coupon**  
8. **Cashier Account**  
9. **Inventory**  
10. **Payment**  
11. **(optional) Notification**  
12. **(optional) Shift**

---

Justifications for Retained Classes

- **Order**: Central to the domain; nearly every story involves order creation, status changes, or modifications.  
- **Product**: Orders comprise one or more products; product statuses are tracked separately (e.g., “current,” “finished”).  
- **Special Request**: Mentioned multiple times (e.g., “no onions,” “extra cheese”); not just a simple attribute because it can differ by product.  
- **Customer**: A core actor entity that places orders, requests changes, etc.  
- **Employee**: Staff entity (kitchen, cashier, ticket master) share fundamental properties such as working shifts, receiving tips; the roles are attributes or sub-roles of Employee.  
- **Ticket**: Physical or digital “receipt” or “ticket” is repeatedly referenced (e.g., “print a ticket,” “digital ticket to the kitchen”).  
- **Coupon**: Represents discount logic. Distinct from the Order itself, but related.  
- **Cashier Account**: Explicitly mentioned for tracking end-of-shift balances.  
- **Inventory**: The owner needs to know sold products for restocking, implying a domain-level inventory concept.  
- **Payment**: Payment methods, tip additions, confirmations, etc. are repeatedly mentioned.  

Removed or Merged Terms

- **Status**, **Progress**, **Order Number**, **Pickup Time**, **Delivery Address**, **Phone Number**, etc.: All merged into **Order** (as attributes).  
- **Kitchen Employee**, **Ticket Master**, **Cashier**, **Restaurant Owner**, **Home Delivery Person**: Merged under **Employee** (roles).  
- **Screen**, **Touchscreen**, **Overview**, **Focus**, **Navigation System**, **Misunderstanding**, **Changes**, **Label**, **Preparation**: User-interface or process/action concepts, not domain entities.  
- **Incoming/Current/Finished/Scheduled Orders**, **Home Delivery Orders**: All are just variations (statuses or subtypes) of **Order**.  
- **VAT/Taxes**, **Price**, **Requested Time**, **Coupon Activation**: All stored as attributes or handled within **Order** or **Payment**.

Optional Classes

1. **(optional) Notification**  
   - The system could generate ephemeral alerts or store them persistently. If the domain requires storing details about each notification (time, read/unread status, etc.), it could be a class. Otherwise, it remains just an event/operation.  

2. **(optional) Shift**  
   - Shifts could be modeled as separate entities (start/end times, assigned employees, total tips) or as simple attributes (e.g., “shift ID” on a transaction record). If the project needs robust shift tracking, keep it; otherwise, treat it as an attribute of an Employee or an Account log.

---

## Final Summary

After analyzing all nouns, we retain the following classes as core to the domain:

```
Order, Product, Special Request, Customer, Employee, Ticket, Coupon,
Cashier Account, Inventory, Payment
```
with **Notification** and **Shift** marked as *optional* if the domain needs to store them as persistent entities. All other nouns have been filtered out, either as roles, attributes, or purely user-interface concepts.

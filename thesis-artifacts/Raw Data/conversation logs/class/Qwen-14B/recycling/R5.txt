SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to identify potential classes from these user stories. I remember the user mentioned that the first step is to extract nouns or compound nouns, ignoring subclasses and excluding overly generic terms. Let me go through each user story one by one and list out the nouns I can find.

Starting with the first user story: "As a user, I want to click on the address, so that it takes me to a new tab with Google Maps." Here, the nouns I can extract are 'address' and 'Google Maps'. 'Address' is a physical entity, and 'Google Maps' is a conceptual entity related to mapping services.

Next, "As a user, I want to be able to anonymously view public information, so that I know about recycling centers near me before creating an account." The nouns here are 'public information' and 'recycling centers'. 'Public information' is conceptual, and 'recycling centers' are physical entities.

Moving on, "As a user, I want to be able to enter my zip code and get a list of nearby recycling facilities, so that I can determine which ones I should consider." The nouns are 'zip code', 'recycling facilities', and 'list'. 'Zip code' is a conceptual entity, 'recycling facilities' are physical, and 'list' is a generic term, but I'll include it as per the instruction not to exclude it yet.

The next one: "As a user, I want to be able to get the hours of each recycling facility, so that I can arrange drop-offs on my off days or during after-work hours." Here, the nouns are 'hours' and 'recycling facility'. 'Hours' is a conceptual entity related to time, and 'recycling facility' is physical.

Continuing, "As a user, I want to have a flexible pick up time, so that I can more conveniently use the website." The noun here is 'time', which is a generic term, but I'll note it.

Next, "As a user, I want to be able to select different types of recyclable waste, so I have and get a list of facilities that accept each type and their opening hours, so that I can find an optimal route and schedule." The nouns are 'recyclable waste', 'facilities', 'opening hours', and 'route'. 'Recyclable waste' is a physical entity, 'facilities' are physical, 'opening hours' is conceptual, and 'route' is a physical entity.

"View a map display of the public recycling bins around my area." The nouns are 'map display', 'public recycling bins', and 'area'. 'Map display' is a conceptual entity, 'public recycling bins' are physical, and 'area' is a physical entity.

Similarly, "View a map display of the special waste drop off sites around my area." The nouns are the same as above, just 'special waste drop off sites' instead of 'public recycling bins'.

"I want to view a map display of the safe disposal events currently being organised around my area." Here, the nouns are 'map display', 'safe disposal events', and 'area'. 'Safe disposal events' are conceptual.

"Choose a flexible pick up time, so that I can more conveniently use the website." The noun is 'time' again.

"Communicate directly with the site admin and convey any issues or concerns I have, so that they fix them." The nouns are 'site admin' and 'issues'. 'Site admin' is a physical entity, 'issues' are conceptual.

Now, compiling all these nouns and compound nouns, I need to make sure I'm ignoring subclasses and excluding overly generic terms. So, I'll go through the list and remove terms like 'list', 'time', 'stuff', 'feedback', 'notifications', etc., as they are too generic or vague.

So, the potential classes identified are:

- Address
- Google Maps
- Public Information
- Recycling Centers
- Zip Code
- Recycling Facility
- Email ID
- Profile
- Map Display
- Public Recycling Bins
- Special Waste Drop Off Sites
- Safe Disposal Events
- Account
- Admin
- Recycling Facilities Information
- Users
- IP Address
- Websites
- Dashboard
- Data
- Company
- Route Planning System
- Neighbourhood
- Employees
- API
- iOS Application
- Rewards
- Personal Information
- Database
- User Activities
- Website
- Notifications
- Activity Fees
- Bill Statement
- Bootstrap
- UI/UX
- Locations
- Schedule
- Email Account
- Administrators
- Recycling Center Information
- Platform
- Superuser
- User Error Logs
- System
- Facilities
- Ecological Footprint
- Material
- Equipment
- Capacity
- Recyclable Materials
- Site Admin
- Issues

Wait, but some of these might be too generic. For example, 'Users' could be a class, but it's quite broad. However, the instruction says not to exclude overly generic terms unless they are like 'thing' or 'item'. So, I'll include them.

I think I've covered all the nouns and compound nouns from each user story. Now, I should list them without duplicates, ensuring each is a distinct class. Let me verify each one:

- Address
- Google Maps
- Public Information
- Recycling Centers
- Zip Code
- Recycling Facility
- Email ID
- Profile
- Map Display
- Public Recycling Bins
- Special Waste Drop Off Sites
- Safe Disposal Events
- Account
- Admin
- Recycling Facilities

USER :


    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

<think>
Alright, so I need to filter the classes I identified earlier, removing any that don't fit the criteria. Let me go through each one step by step.

Starting with 'Address' â that's definitely a physical entity, so it's relevant.

'Google Maps' is a conceptual entity related to mapping services, so it's relevant.

'Public Information' â that's a conceptual entity, but it's a bit vague. I'm not sure if it's too broad. Maybe it's better to keep it as it's needed for recycling center info.

'Recycling Centers' â definitely relevant as they are the main focus of the user stories.

'Zip Code' â a conceptual entity used for location, so it's relevant.

'Recycling Facility' â similar to Recycling Centers, so maybe redundant. I can keep 'Recycling Centers' as it's more specific.

'Email ID' â a conceptual entity used for user accounts, so it's relevant.

'Profile' â a conceptual entity for user data, relevant.

'Map Display' â a conceptual entity related to showing locations, relevant.

'Public Recycling Bins' â a specific type of Recycling Centers, so perhaps redundant. I can keep 'Recycling Centers' as the broader class.

'Special Waste Drop Off Sites' â another specific type, so redundant. Again, 'Recycling Centers' covers this.

'Safe Disposal Events' â a conceptual entity, relevant.

'Account' â a conceptual entity for user authentication, relevant.

'Admin' â a role, not an entity. So, I should exclude this as per the instructions.

'Recycling Facilities Information' â this seems redundant with 'Recycling Facilities' and 'Information' is too vague. Maybe exclude.

'Users' â a role or conceptual entity, but it's also a broad term. I think it's better to exclude as it's too generic unless specifically needed.

'IP Address' â a technical term, part of the system, not a domain entity. Exclude.

'Websites' â an implementation construct, as it's about the system. Exclude.

'Dashboard' â an implementation construct, part of the admin interface. Exclude.

'Data' â too vague, as it's a generic term. Exclude.

'Company' â a physical entity, but not central to the user stories. Maybe irrelevant, so exclude.

'Route Planning System' â an implementation construct, part of the system. Exclude.

'Neighbourhood' â a physical entity, relevant as it's part of location-based services.

'Employees' â a role, not an entity. Exclude.

'API' â an implementation construct, part of the technical side. Exclude.

'iOS Application' â an implementation construct, part of the system. Exclude.

'Rewards' â a conceptual entity, relevant as it's part of user incentives.

'Personal Information' â a conceptual entity, relevant for user accounts.

'Database' â a technical term, part of the system. Exclude.

'User Activities' â a conceptual entity, relevant for tracking user actions.

'Website' â already considered, but it's an implementation construct. Exclude.

'Notifications' â a conceptual entity, relevant for user communication.

'Activity Fees' â a conceptual entity, relevant for billing purposes.

'Bill Statement' â a conceptual entity, relevant for financial transactions.

'Bootstrap' â a technical term, part of the system. Exclude.

'UI/UX' â a conceptual entity related to design, but perhaps too vague. Maybe exclude or mark as optional.

'Locations' â a conceptual entity, relevant as it's about where recycling centers are.

'Schedule' â a conceptual entity, relevant for user planning.

'Email Account' â a conceptual entity, relevant for user authentication.

'Administrators' â a role, not an entity. Exclude.

'Recycling Center Information' â redundant with 'Recycling Centers' and 'Information' is vague. Exclude.

'Platform' â an implementation construct, part of the system. Exclude.

'Superuser' â a role, not an entity. Exclude.

'User Error Logs' â a conceptual entity, relevant for debugging and support.

'System' â an implementation construct, part of the system. Exclude.

'Facilities' â a physical entity, relevant as it refers to recycling centers.

'Ecological Footprint' â a conceptual entity, relevant for user considerations.

'Material' â a conceptual entity, relevant for specifying what recycling centers accept.

'Equipment' â a conceptual entity, relevant for facility upgrades.

'Capacity' â a conceptual entity, relevant for facility planning.

'Recyclable Materials' â a physical entity, relevant as it's the waste being recycled.

'Site Admin' â a role, not an entity. Exclude.

'Issues' â a conceptual entity, relevant for tracking problems.

After this filtering, the remaining suitable classes are:

- Address
- Google Maps
- Public Information
- Recycling Centers
- Zip Code
- Email ID

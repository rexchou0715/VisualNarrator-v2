    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to identify potential classes from a set of user stories. The user provided a detailed list of user stories from different roles like Kitchen Employee, Ticket Master, Cashier, etc. My task is to go through each story and extract nouns, ignoring subclasses and overly generic terms. 

Let me start by reading through some of the user stories to get a sense of the context. For example, the first story is from a Kitchen Employee: "I want to see the orders with their status, so that I am aware of the progress of each order." Here, the nouns are "orders" and "status." 

I need to make sure I capture all nouns, whether they're physical entities like "orders" or more conceptual like "status." I should avoid terms like "thing" or "item." 

Looking at another story: "As a Kitchen Employee, I want to receive a notification when a new order is received." Here, "notification" and "order" are the nouns. 

Moving on to the Ticket Master stories, there are mentions of "incoming orders," "current orders," "finished orders," and "scheduled orders." These are all different statuses of orders, so they should each be considered as separate classes or perhaps as attributes of the Order class. 

Wait, but the instruction says to focus on the nouns themselves without considering subclasses. So maybe "incoming orders" is a subclass of "order," but I shouldn't consider that. Instead, just note "orders" as a class and maybe "status" as another class. Hmm, but status is an attribute, not a separate class. Maybe I should still list "status" as a potential class because it's a noun.

Looking at the Cashier stories, terms like "ticket," "order details," "order," "pickup time," "delivery address," "phone number," "customerâs name," "special requests," "payment methods," "tip," "coupons," and "price" come up. These are all nouns. 

For the Restaurant Owner stories, there's "VAT," "products," "orders," "prices," "tips," "cashier accounts," "cash," and "revenue." 

The Home Delivery Person stories mention "address," "ticket," "order price," "phone number," and "customer." 

Now, compiling all these nouns, I should list them out, making sure to avoid duplicates and overly generic terms. For example, "order" appears multiple times, so I'll list it once. Similarly, "ticket" is mentioned in several places, so that should be included.

I should also consider whether each noun represents a distinct concept. For instance, "status" could be an attribute of "order," but since it's a noun, it might warrant its own class. Similarly, "payment methods" could be a class, but perhaps it's better to consider "payment" as a class with different methods as attributes.

Wait, but the user stories refer to "payment methods" as a plural noun, so that might be a class. Alternatively, maybe "payment" is a better class, but I'm not sure. I think I should go with the exact terms used in the stories.

I also need to check if any of these nouns are too generic, like "information." But in the stories, it's more specific, like "order details" or "order type," so those should be included as separate classes.

Let me go through each user story one by one and extract the nouns:

1. Kitchen Employee: "orders," "status"
2. Kitchen Employee: "orders," "overview"
3. Kitchen Employee: "products," "order"
4. Kitchen Employee: "special requests," "product," "order"
5. Kitchen Employee: "order number," "products," "order"
6. Kitchen Employee: "notification," "order"
7. Kitchen Employee: "notification," "order"
8. Ticket Master: "orders," "incoming orders," "status"
9. Ticket Master: "products," "current orders," "status"
10. Ticket Master: "products," "finished orders," "status"
11. Ticket Master: "products," "scheduled orders," "status"
12. Ticket Master: "incoming orders," "overview"
13. Ticket Master: "orders," "current orders," "overview"
14. Ticket Master: "orders," "finished orders," "overview"
15. Ticket Master: "scheduled orders," "overview"
16. Ticket Master: "scheduled orders," "separation"
17. Ticket Master: "statuses," "products," "order"
18. Ticket Master: "colors," "status"
19. Ticket Master: "order type"
20. Ticket Master: "screen," "touchscreen"
21. Ticket Master: "orders," "selection"
22. Ticket Master: "order," "deletion"
23. Customer: "screen," "order"
24. Customer: "confirmation," "payment"
25. Cashier: "ticket," "printing," "order details"
26. Cashier: "ticket," "printing," "order details"
27. Cashier: "changes," "order"
28. Cashier: "changes," "order"
29. Cashier: "order type"
30. Cashier: "pickup time," "order"
31. Cashier: "ticket," "digital," "order"
32. Cashier: "delivery address," "order"
33. Cashier: "phone number," "order"
34. Cashier: "customerâs name," "order"
35. Cashier: "special requests," "product"
36. Cashier: "payment methods"
37. Cashier: "tip," "price," "payment"
38. Cashier: "coupons," "order"
39. Restaurant Owner: "VAT," "order"
40. Restaurant Owner: "products," "orders," "sales"
41. Restaurant Owner: "order types," "overview"
42. Restaurant Owner: "prices," "order"
43. Restaurant Owner: "orders," "search"
44. Restaurant Owner: "tips," "employee," "distribution"
45. Restaurant Owner: "cashier accounts," "balances"
46. Restaurant Owner: "cash," "delivery," "revenue"
47. Home Delivery Person: "address," "ticket"
48. Home Delivery Person: "delivery address," "order"
49. Home Delivery Person: "order price," "ticket"
50. Home Delivery Person: "phone number," "customer"

Now, compiling all these nouns, I need to list them without duplicates and ensuring they are specific. Let me go through each one:

- Orders
- Status
- Products
- Overview
- Special requests
- Notification
- Incoming orders
- Current orders
- Finished orders
- Scheduled orders
- Separation
- Statuses
- Colors
- Order type
- Screen
- Touchscreen
- Selection
- Deletion
- Ticket
- Printing
- Order details
- Changes
- Pickup time
- Digital
- Delivery address
- Phone number
- Customerâs name
- Payment methods
- Tip
- Price
- Coupons
- VAT
- Products (again)
- Sales
- Cashier accounts
- Balances
- Cash
- Delivery
- Revenue
- Search
- Tips (again)
- Employee
- Navigation system
- Customer

Wait, I think I might have missed some. Let me make sure I captured all:

From the first set: orders, status.

Second: orders, overview.

Third: products, order.

Fourth: special requests, product, order.

Fifth: order number, products, order.

Sixth: notification, order.

Seventh: notification, order.

Eighth: orders, incoming orders, status.

Ninth: products, current orders, status.

Tenth: products, finished orders, status.

Eleventh: products, scheduled orders, status.

Twelfth: incoming orders, overview.

Thirteenth: orders, current orders, overview.

Fourteenth: orders, finished orders, overview.

Fifteenth: scheduled orders, overview.

Sixteenth: scheduled orders, separation.

Seventeenth: statuses, products, order.

Eighteenth: colors, status.

Nineteenth: order type.

Twentieth: screen, touchscreen.

Twenty-first: orders, selection.

Twenty-second: order, deletion.

Twenty-third: screen, order.

Twenty-fourth: confirmation, payment.

Twenty-fifth: ticket, printing, order details.

Twenty-sixth: ticket, printing, order details.

Twenty-seventh: changes, order.

Twenty-eighth: changes, order.

Twenty-ninth: order type.

Thirtieth: pickup time, order.

Thirty-first: ticket, digital, order.

Thirty-second: delivery address, order.

Thirty-third: phone number, order.

Thirty-fourth: customerâs name, order.

Thirty-fifth: special requests, product.

Thirty-sixth: payment methods.

Thirty-seventh: tip, price, payment.

Thirty-eighth: coupons, order.

Thirty-ninth: VAT, order.

Fortieth: products, orders, sales.

Forty-first: order types, overview.

Forty-second: prices, order.

Forty-third: orders, search.

Forty-fourth: tips, employee, distribution.

Forty-fifth: cashier accounts, balances.

Forty-sixth: cash, delivery, revenue.

Forty-seventh: address, ticket.

Forty-eighth: delivery address, order.

Forty-ninth: order price, ticket.

Fiftieth: phone number, customer.

Now, compiling all unique terms:

Orders, Status, Products, Overview, Special requests, Notification, Incoming orders, Current orders, Finished orders, Scheduled orders, Separation, Statuses, Colors, Order type, Screen, Touchscreen, Selection, Deletion, Ticket, Printing, Order details, Changes, Pickup time, Digital, Delivery address, Phone number, Customerâs name, Payment methods, Tip, Price, Coupons, VAT, Sales, Cashier accounts, Balances, Cash, Delivery, Revenue, Search, Tips, Employee, Navigation system, Customer.

Wait, "navigation system" comes from the Home Delivery Person's story: "I want to have the address printed on the ticket, so that I can directly type the address into the navigation system." So that's another noun.

Similarly, "customer" is mentioned.

Now, I need to make sure I don't include overly generic terms. For example, "information" isn't mentioned, so I don't need to worry about that here. All the terms seem specific enough.

I should also consider if any of these should be grouped. For example, "incoming orders," "current orders," etc., are all types of "orders," but as per the instructions, I shouldn't consider subclasses, so I'll list them as separate classes if they are distinct nouns. However, in the user stories, "incoming orders" is a status, so perhaps it's better to treat "status" as a class and have different status types as attributes. But since "incoming orders" is a noun, I might list it as a separate class.

Alternatively, maybe "order" is a class, and "status" is an attribute of it. But since the user stories refer to "incoming orders" as a separate entity, perhaps it's better to treat them as separate classes.

But I think the correct approach is to list each noun as a potential class, even if they are related. So "order" and "incoming orders" would both be classes. However, sometimes "incoming orders" might be considered a subclass of "orders," but since we're not considering subclasses, we'll include both.

Similarly, "products" and "order details" are separate classes.

I need to make sure I don't miss any terms. Let me count how many unique nouns I have:

1. Orders
2. Status
3. Products
4. Overview
5. Special requests
6. Notification
7. Incoming orders
8. Current orders
9. Finished orders
10. Scheduled orders
11. Separation
12. Statuses
13. Colors
14. Order type
15. Screen
16. Touchscreen
17. Selection
18. Deletion
19. Ticket
20. Printing
21. Order details
22. Changes
23. Pickup time
24. Digital
25. Delivery address
26. Phone number
27. Customerâs name
28. Payment methods
29. Tip
30. Price
31. Coupons
32. VAT
33. Sales
34. Cashier accounts
35. Balances
36. Cash
37. Delivery
38. Revenue
39. Search
40. Tips
41. Employee
42. Navigation system
43. Customer

Wait, I think I might have missed "products" again in some stories, but I think I included it once. Let me check:

From story 3: products, order.

Story 4: special requests, product, order.

Story 9: products, current orders, status.

So "products" is a class, and "product" is another class? Or are they the same? "Product" is singular, "products" plural, but they refer to the same thing. So maybe just "Product" as a class.

Similarly, "order" and "orders" are the same, so I can just list "Order."

Same with "status" and "statuses." So perhaps I should standardize to singular nouns unless the plural is a distinct concept.

But in the user stories, sometimes "statuses" is used, but it's plural. However, "status" is a singular noun. So perhaps I can treat "status" as a class and not list "statuses" separately.

Similarly, "special requests" could be a class, as it's a plural noun.

Let me try to refine the list:

Order, Status, Product, Overview, Special requests, Notification, Incoming order, Current order, Finished order, Scheduled order, Separation, Color, Order type, Screen, Touchscreen, Selection,

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

<think>
Alright, so I've moved on to Step 2: Filtering Unsuitable Classes. I've got a list of potential classes from the previous step, and now I need to go through each one to see if they should be included, excluded, or marked as optional.

First, I'll start by recalling the list of potential classes:

Order, Status, Product, Overview, Special requests, Notification, Incoming order, Current order, Finished order, Scheduled order, Separation, Color, Order type, Screen, Touchscreen, Selection, Deletion, Ticket, Printing, Order details, Changes, Pickup time, Digital, Delivery address, Phone number, Customerâs name, Payment methods, Tip, Price, Coupons, VAT, Sales, Cashier accounts, Balances, Cash, Delivery, Revenue, Search, Tips, Employee, Navigation system, Customer.

Now, I need to apply the criteria for filtering:

1. **Redundant Classes**: These are classes that refer to the same concept. For example, "Incoming order" and "Order" are related, but "Incoming order" is more specific. I should keep the more specific or descriptive name. So, perhaps "Incoming order" is redundant if "Order" is already there, but since they represent different statuses, maybe both should be kept as they represent different states of an order.

2. **Irrelevant Classes**: These are classes that have little to do with the domain. For example, "Screen" is part of the system but might not be a core domain concept. However, in the context of a restaurant management system, "Screen" could be relevant for the interface used by employees. I'm not sure yet.

3. **Vague Classes**: Classes that are too broad. "Overview" is a good example. It's too vague because it doesn't represent a specific entity but rather a view or summary. So, "Overview" should be excluded.

4. **Operations (Actions/Events)**: Nouns that represent actions rather than entities. "Notification," "Printing," "Selection," "Deletion," "Changes," "Search" all seem to represent actions or events. For example, "Notification" is something that happens, not an entity. So, these should be excluded unless they represent an entity, like a "Notification" record.

5. **Implementation Constructs**: Technical terms not part of the real-world domain. "Touchscreen," "Digital," "Navigation system," "Printing" could fall into this category as they are more about the technology used rather than the business concepts. However, "Touchscreen" might be part of the interface, which is a domain concept.

6. **Derived Classes**: Classes that can be inferred from others. For example, "Incoming order" might be a type of "Order," so it could be derived. But since we're not considering subclasses, I might keep them as separate.

7. **Roles**: Classes that indicate relationships. "Employee" is a role, but in this context, it's more of a domain concept as it refers to different roles within the restaurant, like Cashier, Kitchen Employee, etc.

8. **Attributes**: Descriptive properties. "Color," "Price," "Status" could be attributes of other classes like "Order" or "Product." However, "Status" is used as a class in the user stories, so it might warrant its own class.

Now, let's go through each class:

- **Order**: Core domain concept, definitely relevant.
- **Status**: Used as a class, relevant.
- **Product**: Core, relevant.
- **Overview**: Vague, exclude.
- **Special requests**: Specific, relevant.
- **Notification**: Operation/event, exclude unless treated as an entity.
- **Incoming order**: Derived but might be kept as a separate class since it's a specific status.
- **Current order**: Derived, might be kept.
- **Finished order**: Derived, might be kept.
- **Scheduled order**: Derived, might be kept.
- **Separation**: Not clear, possibly optional.
- **Color**: Attribute, exclude unless used as a class for status colors.
- **Order type**: Specific, relevant.
- **Screen**: Implementation construct, possibly exclude.
- **Touchscreen**: Implementation, exclude.
- **Selection**: Operation, exclude.
- **Deletion**: Operation, exclude.
- **Ticket**: Core, relevant.
- **Printing**: Operation, exclude.
- **Order details**: Attribute, exclude.
- **Changes**: Operation, exclude.
- **Pickup time**: Attribute, exclude.
- **Digital**: Implementation, exclude.
- **Delivery address**: Relevant, keep.
- **Phone number**: Attribute, exclude.
- **Customerâs name**: Attribute, exclude.
- **Payment methods**: Relevant, keep.
- **Tip**: Relevant, keep.
- **Price**: Attribute, exclude.
- **Coupons**: Relevant, keep.
- **VAT**: Relevant, keep.
- **Sales**: Relevant, keep.
- **Cashier accounts**: Relevant, keep.
- **Balances**: Attribute, exclude.
- **Cash**: Relevant, keep.
- **Delivery**: Relevant, keep.
- **Revenue**: Relevant, keep.
- **Search**: Operation, exclude.
- **Tips**: Same as "Tip," redundant, exclude.
- **Employee**: Role, but relevant as a domain concept, keep.
- **Navigation system**: Implementation, exclude.
- **Customer**: Core, keep.

After this analysis, I need to decide which classes to keep. I'll list the ones I think are suitable:

- Order
- Status
- Product
- Special requests
- Incoming order
- Current order
- Finished order
- Scheduled order
- Order type
- Ticket
- Delivery address
- Payment methods
- Tip
- Coupons
- VAT
- Sales
- Cashier accounts
- Cash
- Delivery
- Revenue
- Employee
- Customer

I'm considering "Incoming order," "Current order," etc., as separate classes because they represent different states of an Order. However, if we're adhering strictly to not considering subclasses, perhaps "Order" is the primary class, and "Status" is an attribute of it. But since the user stories refer to different types of orders, it might make sense to have separate classes for each status.

"Overview" and "Printing" are excluded as they are vague or operations. "Screen" and "Touchscreen" are implementation details, so they're out. "Color" could be an attribute of "Status," so it's excluded as a class unless needed for visualization.

"Changes" and "Search" are operations, so they're excluded. "Phone number" and "Customerâs name" are attributes, so they're out unless needed as separate entities, but I think they belong to "Customer" or "Order."

"Pickup time" is an attribute of an Order, so it's excluded. "Digital" is an implementation detail. "Navigation system" is also implementation-related.

"Balances" and "Revenue" could be part of "Cashier accounts" or "Sales," so they might be attributes.

"Deletion" is an operation, so it's excluded. "Selection" is also an operation.

"Order details" is an attribute of "Order," so it's excluded.

"Employee" is a role but relevant as a domain concept, so it's kept.

"Customer" is a core class.

"Tip" is relevant, so it's kept.

"Payment methods" are relevant.

"Coupons" are relevant.

"VAT" is relevant.

"Sales" are relevant.

"Cashier accounts" are relevant.

"Cash" and "Revenue" are relevant financial aspects.

"Delivery" is relevant as it's part of the order process.

So, the final list after filtering would include:

Order, Status, Product, Special requests, Incoming order, Current order, Finished order, Scheduled order, Order type, Ticket, Delivery address, Payment methods, Tip, Coupons, VAT, Sales, Cashier accounts, Cash, Delivery, Revenue, Employee, Customer.

I think this makes sense. Each of these represents a distinct concept within the domain described by the user stories. Some might argue about whether "Incoming order" should be a subclass of "Order," but since we're not considering subclasses, it's kept as a separate class. Similarly, "Status" is a separate class because it's used extensively in the user stories as a noun.
</think>

**Step 2: Filtered Suitable Classes**

After evaluating each potential class based on the criteria provided, the following classes are deemed suitable and relevant to the domain described by the user stories:

1. **Order**: Core entity representing a customer's request for products or services.
2. **Status**: Represents the state of an order, such as pending, preparing, or completed.
3. **Product**: Items offered by the restaurant, such as food or drinks.
4. **Special requests**: Customizations or additional instructions related to an order.
5. **Incoming order**: An order that has been received but not yet processed.
6. **Current order**: An order that is currently being prepared or processed.
7. **Finished order**: An order that has been completed and is ready for pickup or delivery.
8. **Scheduled order**: An order with aé¢å®æ¶é´, scheduled for later processing.
9. **Order type**: Differentiates between types of orders, such as dine-in, takeaway, or delivery.
10. **Ticket**: A record or document used for an order, often printed or digital.
11. **Delivery address**: The location where an order is to be delivered.
12. **Payment methods**: The various ways customers can pay for their orders.
13. **Tip**: An additional amount paid by the customer as a gratuity.
14. **Coupons**: Discounts or offers applied to an order.
15. **VAT**: Value Added Tax applicable to orders.
16. **Sales**: The total revenue generated from orders.
17. **Cashier accounts**: Records related to the financial transactions handled by cashiers.
18. **Cash**: Physical money handled during transactions.
19. **Delivery**: The process of transporting orders to customers.
20. **Revenue**: The total income generated from all sales.
21. **Employee**: Individuals working in the restaurant, such as cashiers or kitchen staff.
22. **Customer**: The end-user who places orders.

Alright, I'm trying to complete Step 3 of identifying potential classes from the user stories provided. This step involves presenting the final list of classes in a structured format, explaining why each class was retained, and marking any optional classes that are ambiguous.

First, I need to review the classes identified in Step 1 and filter out the unsuitable ones based on the criteria provided in Step 2. The criteria for filtering include removing redundant classes, irrelevant classes, vague classes, operations, implementation constructs, derived classes, roles, attributes, and keeping only those classes that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts.

Looking back at the classes identified in Step 1, I have a list of nouns such as "orders," "status," "products," "overview," "special requests," "notification," "incoming orders," "current orders," "finished orders," "scheduled orders," "separation," "statuses," "colors," "order type," "screen," "touchscreen," "selection," "deletion," "ticket," "printing," "order details," "changes," "pickup time," "digital," "delivery address," "phone number," "customerâs name," "payment methods," "tip," "price," "coupons," "VAT," "sales," "cashier accounts," "balances," "cash," "delivery," "revenue," "search," "tips," "employee," and "customer."

Now, I need to go through each of these and decide if they should be retained or removed based on the filtering criteria.

1. **Orders**: This is a core entity representing a customer's request for products or services. It is relevant to the domain and should be retained.

2. **Status**: Represents the state of an order, such as pending, preparing, or completed. This is important for tracking order progress and should be retained.

3. **Products**: Items offered by the restaurant, such as food or drinks. This is a fundamental concept in the domain and should be retained.

4. **Overview**: This term is somewhat vague. It refers to a general view or summary of something, but it doesn't represent a discrete entity. It doesn't meet the criteria for a suitable class and should be removed.

5. **Special Requests**: Customizations or additional instructions related to an order. This is relevant and should be retained.

6. **Notification**: This represents an action or event, not an entity. It is an operation and should be removed.

7. **Incoming Orders**: Orders that have been received but not yet processed. This is a specific type of order and should be retained.

8. **Current Orders**: Orders that are currently being prepared or processed. This is specific and relevant, so it should be retained.

9. **Finished Orders**: Orders that have been completed and are ready for pickup or delivery. This is specific and relevant, so it should be retained.

10. **Scheduled Orders**: Orders with aé¢å®æ¶é´, scheduled for later processing. This is specific and relevant, so it should be retained.

11. **Separation**: This term is vague. It refers to the act of separating or dividing, but it doesn't represent a discrete entity. It should be removed.

12. **Statuses**: Similar to "status," but plural. Since "status" already captures the concept, this is redundant and should be removed.

13. **Colors**: This is somewhat vague. While it could be relevant to how statuses are displayed, it doesn't represent a core entity in the domain. It should be removed.

14. **Order Type**: Differentiates between types of orders, such as dine-in, takeaway, or delivery. This is relevant and should be retained.

15. **Screen**: This refers to a technical or implementation construct, not a core domain entity. It should be removed.

16. **Touchscreen**: Similar to "screen," it is a technical construct and should be removed.

17. **Selection**: This refers to an action or operation, not an entity. It should be removed.

18. **Deletion**: This is an operation, not an entity. It should be removed.

19. **Ticket**: A record or document used for an order, often printed or digital. This is relevant and should be retained.

20. **Printing**: This is an operation, not an entity. It should be removed.

21. **Order Details**: Specific information about an order. This could be considered part of the "Order" class and is somewhat redundant. It should be removed.

22. **Changes**: This refers to actions made to an order, not an entity. It should be removed.

23. **Pickup Time**: The time when an order is ready for pickup. This is relevant and should be retained.

24. **Digital**: This is a general term and doesn't represent a discrete entity. It should be removed.

25. **Delivery Address**: The location where an order is to be delivered. This is relevant and should be retained.

26. **Phone Number**: Contact information for the customer. This is relevant and should be retained.

27. **Customerâs Name**: Personal information of the customer. This is relevant and should be retained.

28. **Payment Methods**: The various ways customers can pay for their orders. This is relevant and should be retained.

29. **Tip**: An additional amount paid by the customer as a gratuity. This is relevant and should be retained.

30. **Price**: The cost of a product or service. This is fundamental and should be retained.

31. **Coupons**: Discounts or offers applied to an order. This is relevant and should be retained.

32. **VAT**: Value Added Tax applicable to orders. This is relevant and should be retained.

33. **Sales**: The total revenue generated from orders. This is relevant and should be retained.

34. **Cashier Accounts**: Records related to the financial transactions handled by cashiers. This is relevant and should be retained.

35. **Balances**: Financial balances, likely related to cashier accounts. This is somewhat redundant with "Cashier Accounts" but could be retained for clarity.

36. **Cash**: Physical money handled during transactions. This is relevant and should be retained.

37. **Delivery**: The process of transporting orders to customers. This is relevant and should be retained.

38. **Revenue**: The total income generated from all sales. This is relevant and should be retained.

39. **Search**: This refers to an action or operation, not an entity. It should be removed.

40. **Tips**: Similar to "tip," but plural. Since "Tip" already captures the concept, this is redundant and should be removed.

41. **Employee**: Individuals working in the restaurant, such as cashiers or kitchen staff. This is relevant and should be retained.

42. **Customer**: The end-user who places orders. This is fundamental and should be retained.

After this evaluation, the final list of suitable classes is as follows:

1. **Order**

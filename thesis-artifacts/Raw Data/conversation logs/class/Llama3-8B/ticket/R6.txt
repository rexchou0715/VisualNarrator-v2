SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

### Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes

2.  **Payment details**: This class is redundant as it can be inferred from the more specific classes like **Account** and **Bank account**.

#### Irrelevant Classes

1.  **Search engine**: This class is not directly relevant to the domain as it is more of a system-level concept.
2.  **Service fee**: This class might be more of an implementation detail rather than a domain concept.

#### Vague Classes

1.  **Platform**: This class is too broad and might include various system-level concepts not directly related to the domain.
2.  **User profile**: This class is too vague as it might include various attributes not directly related to the domain.

#### Operations (Actions/Events)

1.  **Search result**: This class represents an action or event rather than an entity.
2.  **Order summary**: This class represents an action or event rather than an entity.

#### Implementation Constructs

#### Roles

1.  **Reseller**: This class is more of a role rather than an intrinsic identity.
2.  **Artist**: This class is more of a role rather than an intrinsic identity.

#### Attributes

1.  **Name**: This is a descriptive property of the **User** or **Account** class and should not be treated as a standalone class.
2.  **Email**: This is a descriptive property of the **User** or **Account** class and should not be treated as a standalone class.

#### Optional Classes

1.  **Password**: This class might be necessary for secure login, but it could also be considered an implementation detail rather than a domain concept.
2.  **IBAN number**: This class might be necessary for secure transactions, but it could also be considered an implementation detail rather than a domain concept.

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2

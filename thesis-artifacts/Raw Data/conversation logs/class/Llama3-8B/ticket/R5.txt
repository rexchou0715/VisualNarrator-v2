SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

### Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes

Based on the provided user stories and the identified potential classes, the following classes have been filtered out as unsuitable:

#### 1. **SearchEngine** (Redundant Class)

* This class can be considered redundant as the search functionality is already represented by the **SearchResult** class.
* **SearchEngine** can be inferred from the **SearchResult** class, making it a derived class.

#### 2. **SeatingMap** (Implementation Construct)

* This class represents a technical concept related to displaying seating information, rather than a real-world entity.
* It can be inferred from the **Venue** class, making it a derived class.

#### 3. **OrderSummary** (Vague Class)

* This class is too broad and can be considered a descriptive property of an **Order**.
* It does not represent a distinct entity in the domain.

#### 4. **UserAccount** (Vague Class)

* This class is too broad and can be considered a descriptive property of a **User**.
* It does not represent a distinct entity in the domain.

#### 5. **ShoppingCart** (Vague Class)

* This class is too broad and can be considered a descriptive property of a **User**.
* It does not represent a distinct entity in the domain.

#### 6. **DigitalTicket** (Derived Class)

* This class can be entirely inferred from the **Ticket** class.
* It represents a specific type of ticket but is not a distinct entity in the domain.

#### 7. **SearchResult** (Optional)

* This class may or may not be included, as it can be considered a descriptive property of a search query.
* It represents a specific type of result but is not a distinct entity in the domain.

#### 8. **PaymentMethod** (Optional)

* This class may or may not be included, as it can be considered a descriptive property of a **User**.
* It represents a specific type of payment method but is not a distinct entity in the domain.

### Updated List of Suitable Classes:

1. **User**
2. **PaymentDetails**
3. **Profile**
4. **Preferences**
5. **Order**
6. **OrderHistory**
7. **Event**
8. **Artist**

10. **Reseller**
11. **Company**
12. **Venue**
13. **Seating** (instead of **SeatingMap**)
14. **Order** (instead of **OrderSummary**)

### Removed Classes:

2. **SeatingMap**
3. **OrderSummary**
4. **UserAccount**
5. **ShoppingCart**
6. **DigitalTicket**

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

14. (Optional)**PaymentMethod**: (Optional) This class is tentative because it can be inferred from the **PaymentDetails** class. However, it may be useful to distinguish between different payment methods (e.g., credit cards, PayPal) for specific applications.
15. (Optional)**SearchResult**: (Optional) This class is tentative because it can be inferred from the **Event** class. However, it may be useful to capture the results of a search query in a more structured format.

The following classes were removed or merged due to redundancy, vagueness, or implementation constructs:

* **SearchEngine**: Removed as it is redundant with the **SearchResult** class.
* **SeatingMap**: Removed as it is an implementation construct, and the **Seating** class captures the necessary information.
* **OrderSummary**: Removed as it is a vague class that can be inferred from the **Order** class.
* **UserAccount**: Removed as it is a vague class that can be inferred from the **User** class.
* **ShoppingCart**: Removed as it is a vague class that can be inferred from the **User** class.
* **DigitalTicket**: Removed as it is a derived class that can be inferred from the **Ticket** class.

SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

USER :


    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

### Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes

#### Redundant Classes

- **Manager** and **Employee** are both subclasses of **User**. We can remove **Employee** and keep **Manager** as it is more specific.
- **Complaint** and **Ticket** seem to represent the same concept. We can remove **Complaint** and keep **Ticket** as it is more specific.
- **Notification** and **Message** are both subclasses of **Notification**. We can remove **Message** and keep **Notification** as it is more descriptive.
- **Payment** and **Salaries** seem to represent the same concept. We can remove **Salaries** and keep **Payment** as it is more specific.
- **Schedule** and **Work Hours** seem to represent the same concept. We can remove **Work Hours** and keep **Schedule** as it is more specific.
- **Contract** and **Employment Agreement** seem to represent the same concept. We can remove **Employment Agreement** and keep **Contract** as it is more specific.
- **Certificate** and **Qualification** seem to represent the same concept. We can remove **Qualification** and keep **Certificate** as it is more specific.

#### Irrelevant Classes

- **Account System** seems to be an implementation construct and not a domain-relevant concept.
- **Messaging System** seems to be an implementation construct and not a domain-relevant concept.

#### Vague Classes

- **Complaint System** is too vague and can be inferred from **Ticket**. We can remove it.
- **Payment System** is too vague and can be inferred from **Payment**. We can remove it.
- **Hiring System** is too vague and can be inferred from **Applicant**. We can remove it.

#### Operations (Actions/Events)

- **Reset Password** and **Log In** seem to be actions/events rather than entities. We can remove them.
- **Register Account** seems to be an action/event rather than an entity. However, **Applicant** is a noun, so we can keep it.

#### Implementation Constructs

- **System** is a technical term and not a domain-relevant concept. We can remove it.

#### Derived Classes

- **Notification** can be inferred from **Message**. However, **Notification** is a more descriptive term, so we can keep it.

#### Roles

- **User** and **Employee** are both roles, but **Manager** is a role as well. We can remove **User** as it is too broad.

#### Attributes

- **Color** and **Size** are descriptive properties of an entity, so we can remove them.

### Updated Class Diagram

- **Employee**:
  - Has a **Contract**.
  - Has a **Schedule**.
  - Has a **Certificate**.
  - Can file a **Ticket**.
  - Can receive a **Notification**.

- **Manager**:
  - Is an **Employee**.
  - Can hire a new **Applicant**.
  - Can view **Contracts** and **Certificates** of employees.
  - Can view the **Schedule** of employees.
  - Can send a **Notification** to employees.

- **Applicant**:
  - Can register an account.

- **Ticket**:
  - Represents a formal complaint filed through the complaint system.
  - Can be viewed by an **Office Employee**.

- **Payment**:
  - Represents a salary paid to an **Employee**.

- **Schedule**:
  - Represents the planned work hours of an **Employee**.
  - Can be viewed by an **Employee** and a **Manager**.

- **Contract**:
  - Represents the employment agreement between an **Employee** and the organization.

- **Certificate**:
  - Represents the qualification of an **Employee**.

- **Notification**:
  - Can be sent to an **Employee** or a **Manager**.

- **Office Employee**:
  - Can view and respond to **Tickets**.

Note: Some classes like **Applicant**, **Office Employee**, and **Notification** have been adjusted to better fit the domain-relevant concepts.

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

### Step 3: Present the Final Class List

Here is the final list of classes:

1. **Employee**
2. **Manager**
3. **Applicant**
4. **Ticket**
5. **Payment**
6. **Schedule**
7. **Contract**
8. **Certificate**
9. **Notification**
10. **Office Employee**
11. **(Optional) User**

### Rationale for Each Class

1. **Employee**: Retained because it represents a domain-relevant concept and is not redundant.
2. **Manager**: Retained because it represents a domain-relevant concept and is not redundant.
3. **Applicant**: Retained because it represents a domain-relevant concept and is not redundant.
4. **Ticket**: Retained because it represents a domain-relevant concept and is not redundant.
5. **Payment**: Retained because it represents a domain-relevant concept and is not redundant.
6. **Schedule**: Retained because it represents a domain-relevant concept and is not redundant.
7. **Contract**: Retained because it represents a domain-relevant concept and is not redundant.
8. **Certificate**: Retained because it represents a domain-relevant concept and is not redundant.
9. **Notification**: Retained because it represents a domain-relevant concept and is not redundant.
10. **Office Employee**: Retained because it represents a domain-relevant concept and is not redundant.

### Optional Classes

- **User**: (Optional) This class is tentative because it may be redundant with **Employee** and **Manager**.

SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

**Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes**

### Redundant Classes

1. Removed "Employee Presence" as it's similar to "Employee" and not a unique concept.
2. Removed "Employee Presence on Work Floor" as it's similar to "Schedule" and not a unique concept.

### Irrelevant Classes

1. Removed "Country" as it's not directly related to the salary and schedule management domain.

### Vague Classes

1. Removed "Office" as it's a broad term and could refer to many different types of workplaces. However, "Workplace" might be a suitable replacement.

### Operations (Actions/Events)

1. Removed "Payment" as it's more of an action or event than an entity. However, "Payment System" might be a suitable class to represent the payment functionality.
2. Removed "Notification" as it's an action or event rather than an entity. However, "Notification System" might be a suitable class to represent the notification functionality.

### Implementation Constructs

1. Removed "Account" as it's a technical or system-level concept not directly related to the real-world domain. However, "Login" might be a suitable class to represent the login functionality.
2. Removed "Application" as it's a technical or system-level concept not directly related to the real-world domain. However, "User Interface" might be a suitable class to represent the user interface.

### Derived Classes

1. Removed "Login" as it can be entirely inferred from "Account" and "User Interface".

### Roles

1. Removed "Manager" as it's a role rather than an intrinsic identity. However, "Employee" might be a suitable class to represent the entity, and "Manager" could be a role or attribute of the Employee class.

### Attributes

1. Removed "Certificate" as it's a descriptive property of an entity. However, "Employee Qualifications" might be a suitable class to represent the qualifications of an employee.

### Optional Classes

1. "Workplace" - might be a suitable class, but it's not a direct representation of the domain.
2. "Payment System" - might be a suitable class, but it's not directly represented in the user stories.
3. "Notification System" - might be a suitable class, but it's not directly represented in the user stories.
4. "User Interface" - might be a suitable class, but it's not directly represented in the user stories.
5. "Employee Qualifications" - might be a suitable class, but it's not directly represented in the user stories.

### Filtered Classes:

1. Employee
2. Salary Statement
3. Schedule
4. Complaint
5. Ticket
6. Contract
7. Certificate

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

Here is the final list of classes:

1. Employee
2. Salary Statement
3. Schedule
4. Complaint
5. Ticket
6. Contract
7. Workplace
8. Payment Handler
9. Employer
10. (Optional) Certificate : This class is tentative because it could be considered an attribute or a separate entity related to employee qualifications.
11. (Optional) Payment System : This class is tentative because it's not directly represented in the user stories, but it's implied by the payment-related functionality.
12. (Optional) Notification System : This class is tentative because it's not directly represented in the user stories, but it's implied by the notification functionality.
13. (Optional) User Interface : This class is tentative because it's a technical or system-level concept not directly related to the real-world domain, but it's implied by the application's functionality.

Note: I've kept the "Employee Qualifications" idea as an attribute or a separate entity related to "Certificate", but it's not included in the final list as a separate class.

SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

**Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes**

### Redundant Classes

* Both "Salary" and "Payment" are related to financial transactions. Keeping "Payment" as it is more specific and widely applicable.
* "Financial" and "Financial Statement" are similar concepts. Keeping "Financial Statement" as it is more descriptive.
* "Notification" and "Message" are related concepts. Keeping "Notification" as it is more specific and widely applicable.

### Irrelevant Classes

* "Information" is a vague concept that is not specific to the domain.
* "Annual" is not a class but an adjective describing a type of statement.

### Vague Classes

* "System" is a broad term that can refer to multiple concepts. Marking it as "optional" as it may refer to a payroll system or a messaging system, depending on the context.

### Operations (Actions/Events)

* "Hiring" is an action or event rather than an entity. Marking it as "optional" as it may be a process that can be represented by other classes.
* "Manual authorization" and "Manual adjustments" are actions or events rather than entities. Marking them as "optional" as they may be part of a process that can be represented by other classes.

### Implementation Constructs

* "Account" may refer to a technical construct for authentication rather than a real-world entity. Marking it as "optional" as it may be a technical implementation detail.

### Derived Classes

* "Employer" can be entirely inferred from the "Employee" class, as an employer is an employee with a specific set of responsibilities. Marking it as "optional" as it may be a derived concept.

### Roles

* "Manager" is a role that indicates a relationship rather than an intrinsic identity. Marking it as "optional" as it may be a derived concept.

### Attributes

* "Certificate" is an attribute of an employee rather than a standalone class. Marking it as "optional" as it may be a descriptive property of an employee.

### Optional Classes

* "System" (may refer to a payroll system or a messaging system)
* "Account" (may refer to a technical construct for authentication)
* "Employer" (can be entirely inferred from the "Employee" class)
* "Manager" (is a role that indicates a relationship rather than an intrinsic identity)
* "Certificate" (is an attribute of an employee rather than a standalone class)

### Retained Classes

1. Employee
2. Manager
3. Payment
4. Schedule
5. Work
6. Contract
7. Statement
8. Notification
9. Complaint
10. Ticket
11. Workplace
12. Organization
13. Absence
14. Absent
15. Financial Statement
16. Annual
17. Encryption
18. Payment Handler
19. Information

Note: The classification of some classes as optional may depend on the specific requirements of the domain and the desired level of detail in the model.

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1

17. (optional)Workplace: This class is tentative because "Workplace" may be a derived concept from "Work" and "Organization".
18. (optional)System : This class is tentative because "System" may refer to a technical implementation detail or a domain-specific concept.
19. (optional)Account : This class is tentative because "Account" may refer to a technical construct for authentication or a real-world entity.
20. (optional)Certificate : This class is tentative because "Certificate" is an attribute of an employee rather than a standalone class, but it may be treated as a separate entity in certain contexts.
21. (optional)Information : This class is tentative because "Information" is a vague concept that may not be relevant to the domain.
22. (optional)Employer: This class is tentative because "Employer" can be entirely inferred from the "Employee" class, but it may be treated as a separate entity in certain contexts.
23. (optional)Manager : This class is tentative because "Manager" is a role that indicates a relationship rather than an intrinsic identity, but it may be treated as a separate entity in certain contexts.
24. (optional)Annual  : This class is tentative because "Annual" is an adjective describing a type of statement, and it may not be a standalone class.

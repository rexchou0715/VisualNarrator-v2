SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.
    

USER :

As a moderator, I want to have the "estimate" field filled in automatically if all estimators show the same card, so that I can accept it more quickly.
As a moderator, I want to enter the agreed-upon estimate, so that we can move on to the next item when we agree.
As a moderator, I want to estimate a item we estimated earlier in the round again, so that we can give a new estimate if we feel different about the item after estimating other related items.

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

### Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes

Based on the provided user stories, the following classes are considered unsuitable:

1. **Irrelevant Classes:**
   - Browser (not directly relevant to the domain)
   - W3C (more of a guideline or standard, not a domain concept)
   - Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari (specific browsers, not relevant to the domain)

2. **Vague Classes:**
   - Terms (too broad, might include various concepts)
   - Options (could refer to many things, not a specific entity)

3. **Operations (Actions/Events):**
   - Log in (action, not an entity)
   - Change (action, not an entity)
   - Delete (action, not an entity)
   - Invite (action, not an entity)
   - Create (action, not an entity)
   - Accept (action, not an entity)
   - Show (action, not an entity)
   - View (action, not an entity)

4. **Implementation Constructs:**
   - Database (more of a technical concept, not a domain entity)

   - Query (technical concept, not a domain entity)
   - Spreadsheet (technical concept, not a domain entity)
   - Format (technical concept, not a domain entity)
   - File (technical concept, not a domain entity)

5. **Derived Classes:**
   - Estimate (can be inferred from other classes, Item and Moderator)
   - Session (can be inferred from other classes, Moderator and Estimator)
   - Round (can be inferred from other classes, Moderator and Estimator)

6. **Roles:**
   - Moderator (could be considered a role, but it's also an entity)
   - Estimator (could be considered a role, but it's also an entity)
   - Participant (could be considered a role, but it's also an entity)

7. **Attributes:**
   - Username (descriptive property of an entity, not a standalone class)
   - Password (descriptive property of an entity, not a standalone class)
   - Email (descriptive property of an entity, not a standalone class)
   - Photo (descriptive property of an entity, not a standalone class)
   - Thumbnail (descriptive property of an entity, not a standalone class)

### Filtered Classes

After removing the unsuitable classes, the following classes remain:

- Account
- Application
- Card
- Estimate
- Game
- Guidelines
- Item
- Language
- Moderator
- Options
- Participant
- Password
- Photo
- Query
- Round
- Session
- Spreadsheet

- Terms
- Thumbnail
- Transcript
- URL
- User
- W3C

Note that some classes might still be considered optional, depending on the specific requirements and interpretations of the domain.

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

4. Game
5. Guidelines
6. Item

10. Photo
11. Round
12. Session
13. Spreadsheet
14. Team

18. User

Note: I removed the following classes because they were deemed unnecessary or could be inferred from other classes:

- Estimate (could be inferred from other classes, Item and Moderator)
- Options (too broad, could refer to many things)
- Query (more of a technical concept, not a domain entity)
- Terms (too broad, might include various concepts)

I marked no classes as "optional" as they were either clearly suitable or unsuitable based on the provided rules and guidelines.

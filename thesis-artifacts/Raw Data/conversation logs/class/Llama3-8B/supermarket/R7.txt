SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

### Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes

#### Redundant Classes

1. **Newsletter** and **Discount** can be represented by a single class, **Promotion**.
2. **Product information** and **Product** can be combined into a single class, **Product**.
3. **Product suggestions** and **Discount** can be included in the **Promotion** class.

#### Irrelevant Classes

1. **Font** and **Contrast** are not relevant to the domain and can be removed.
2. **Language** is not specific to the domain and can be removed.

#### Vague Classes

1. **Application** is too broad and can be removed.
2. **Customer service** is not a specific concept and can be removed.

#### Operations (Actions/Events)

1. **Scan** and **Update** are actions/events and can be removed.
2. **Notify** and **Contact** are actions/events and can be removed.

#### Implementation Constructs

1. **Barcode** is an implementation construct and can be removed.
2. **Digital payment** is an implementation construct and can be removed.

#### Derived Classes

1. **Order history** can be inferred from the **Order** class.
2. **Previous order** can be inferred from the **Order** class.

#### Roles

1. **Employee** is a role and can be removed.
2. **Customer** is a role and can be removed.

#### Attributes

1. **Location** and **Store location** are attributes of a **Store**.
2. **Product stock** is an attribute of a **Store**.

#### Optional Classes

1. **Recipe meal inspiration** may be included as a separate class if it represents a distinct concept, but it could also be considered an attribute of a **Recipe**.
2. **Inventory** may be included as a separate class if it represents a distinct concept, but it could also be considered an attribute of a **Store**.

### Filtered Classes

1. **Account**
2. **Promotion**
3. **Product**
4. **Store**
5. **Recipe**
6. **Meal**
7. **Order**
8. **Loyalty card**
9. **Recipe meal inspiration** (optional)
10. **Inventory** (optional)

Note: The filtered classes may not be exhaustive, and some classes may be missing. The goal is to identify the most relevant and domain-specific classes.

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

### Step 3: Present the Final Class List

Here is the final list of classes:

1. **Account**
2. **Promotion**
3. **Product**
4. **Store**
5. **Recipe**
6. **Order**
7. **Loyalty card**
8. **Meal**
9. (Optional) **Inventory** : This class is tentative because it could be considered an attribute of a **Store**, but it may also represent a distinct concept in the domain.
10. (Optional) **Recipe meal inspiration** : This class is tentative because it could be considered an attribute of a **Recipe**, but it may also represent a distinct concept in the domain.

### Rationale for Each Class

1. **Account**: This class represents a customer's personal account, which is a domain-specific concept relevant to user stories about creating and managing accounts.
2. **Promotion**: This class combines **Newsletter** and **Discount**, which were redundant, to represent a single concept of promotions and discounts offered to customers.
3. **Product**: This class represents a good or service offered by a company, which is a key concept in the domain.
4. **Store**: This class represents a physical location where products are sold, which is a relevant concept in the domain.
5. **Recipe**: This class represents a set of instructions for preparing a meal, which is a key concept in the domain.
6. **Order**: This class represents a customer's purchase, which is a key concept in the domain.
7. **Loyalty card**: This class represents a card used to track a customer's purchases and rewards, which is a relevant concept in the domain.
8. **Meal**: This class represents a prepared dish, which is a key concept in the domain.

### Explanation for Optional Classes

These classes were marked as optional because they could be considered attributes of other classes or may not represent distinct concepts in the domain. However, they may still be relevant depending on the specific requirements of the system.

SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

USER :


    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

6. **Product Suggestions** - Recommended products based on a customer's buying history.
7. **Discounts** - Reduced prices offered to customers.
8. **Recipes** - Instructions for preparing meals.
9. **Product Information** - Details about a product, such as its packaging and availability.
10. **Store** - A physical location where customers can purchase products.

22. **Customer** - Any person who uses the app to purchase products or manage their account.

**Filtering Unsuitable Classes**

**1. Redundant Classes:**
   - **Product Information** is redundant with **Product Packaging**. Keep **Product Packaging** as it is more descriptive.

**2. Irrelevant Classes:**
   - **Quantity** is an attribute of a product, not a class.
   - **Barcode** is an implementation construct; it is a technical term for a code used to identify a product.

**3. Vague Classes:**
   - **Store** is a vague class. A more specific class should be created, such as **StoreLocation**.

**4. Operations (Actions/Events):**
   - **Newsletter** is an operation (publication sent to customers) rather than an entity. Remove it.
   - **Push Notifications** is an operation (notifications sent to customers) rather than an entity. Remove it.
   - **Payment** is an operation (process of transferring money) rather than an entity. Remove it.
   - **Delivery Time** is an operation (scheduled time for a delivery) rather than an entity. Remove it.

**5. Implementation Constructs:**
   - **Barcode** is an implementation construct and has been removed.
   - **Quantity** is an attribute of a product, not a class, and has been removed.

**6. Derived Classes:**
   - **Product Suggestions** can be derived from **Product** and **Customer**.

**7. Roles:**
   - **Employee** is a role and should be combined with **Customer** to form a more specific class, such as **User**.

**8. Attributes:**
   - **Font Size**, **Contrast**, and **Language** are attributes of the app and should not be standalone classes.

**Filtered Classes:**

1. **Account** - A customer's account information.
2. **Product** - Any item sold in the store or online.
3. **Product Packaging** - The container or wrapping of a product.
4. **Product Availability** - Whether a product is in stock or sold out.
5. **Delivery Service** - A service that delivers products to customers.
6. **Grocery Order** - A collection of products ordered by a customer.
7. **StoreLocation** - The address of a store.
8. **User** - A staff member or customer who uses the app.
9. **Recipe** - Instructions for preparing meals.

**Optional Classes:**

1. **Product Suggestions** - Recommended products based on a customer's buying history. (This class can be inferred from **Product** and **Customer**.)
2. **Discounts** - Reduced prices offered to customers. (This class is not clearly defined in the user stories; it may be a specific type of promotion or a general attribute of a product.)
3. **Product Information** - Details about a product, such as its packaging and availability. (This class is not clearly defined in the user stories; it may be a specific type of information or a general attribute of a product.)

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

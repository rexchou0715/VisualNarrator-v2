SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

### 3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms:

We will exclude terms like "thing," "item," or similarly vague words. In this case, we don't have any such terms.

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

**Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes**

We will apply the filtering criteria to the potential classes identified earlier.

* Removed: Delivery status (not a domain-relevant concept)
* Removed: Employee (while present in some user stories, it's not a primary entity in the domain)

### 3. Vague Classes

* Removed: Discounts (too broad, can refer to various types of discounts)
* Removed: Anomalies (too vague, can refer to various types of anomalies)
* Removed: Suggestions (too vague, can refer to various types of suggestions)

### 4. Operations (Actions/Events)

* Removed: Update (action/event, not an entity)
* Removed: Notify (action/event, not an entity)
* Removed: Confirm (action/event, not an entity)
* Removed: Cancel (action/event, not an entity)
* Removed: Contact (action/event, not an entity)

### 5. Implementation Constructs

* Removed: Application (technical/system-level concept, not part of the real-world domain)

### 6. Derived Classes

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

**Note:** The following classes were removed because they were deemed too vague, too broad, or not relevant to the domain:
- Discounts
- Anomalies
- Suggestions
- Product information
- Availability
- Font size
- Contrast
- Language
- Quantity
- Location

**Optional Classes:**

17. Message (optional) : This class is tentative because it may refer to various types of messages (e.g., notifications, emails) and its scope is not clearly defined within the domain.

18. Recipe ideas (optional) : This class is tentative because it may overlap with Recipe, and its boundaries are not clearly defined within the domain.

19. Barcode (optional) : This class is tentative because it may refer to a specific property of Product, and its scope is not clearly defined within the domain.

20. Product ingredients (optional) : This class is tentative because it may overlap with Product, and its boundaries are not clearly defined within the domain.

**Note:** These optional classes are still ambiguous and may require further clarification or refinement to determine their relevance within the domain.

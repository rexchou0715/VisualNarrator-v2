SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

**Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes**

### 1. Redundant Classes

1. Account and Membership: Duplicate concepts. **Retain Membership**, as it is more descriptive.
2. Customer and User: Duplicate concepts. **Retain Customer**, as it is more descriptive.
3. Information and Personal details: Duplicate concepts. **Retain Personal details**, as it is more specific.

### 2. Irrelevant Classes

1. Thing: A vague, overly generic term.
2. Item: A vague, overly generic term.

### 3. Vague Classes

1. Type: A class with broad boundaries. **Mark as "Optional"**, as it could be a characteristic of other classes.
2. Description: A class with broad boundaries. **Mark as "Optional"**, as it could be a characteristic of other classes.
3. System: A technical, implementation-level concept. **Exclude**.

### 4. Operations (Actions/Events)

1. Booking (as an action): Exclude, but **retain Booking** as an entity, as it represents a concept in the domain.
2. Cancel: An action/event, exclude.
3. Add: An action/event, exclude.
4. Edit: An action/event, exclude.
5. Remove: An action/event, exclude.

### 5. Implementation Constructs

1. Admin (unless explicitly required by the domain): Exclude. **Mark as "Optional"**, as it could be a role or a characteristic of the Customer class.
2. Notifications (unless explicitly required by the domain): Exclude. **Mark as "Optional"**, as it could be a characteristic of the Customer class.

### 6. Derived Classes

1. Family: A class that can be inferred from other classes. **Exclude**.

### 7. Roles

1. Admin: A role, exclude. **Mark as "Optional"**, as it could be a characteristic of the Customer class.
2. Trainer: A role, exclude. **Mark as "Optional"**, as it could be a characteristic of the Customer class.

### 8. Attributes

1. Family (as an attribute): Exclude. **Mark as "Optional"**, as it could be a characteristic of the Customer class.
2. Type (as an attribute): Exclude. **Mark as "Optional"**, as it could be a characteristic of the Customer class.

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

13. (Optional) Admin : This class is tentative because it could be a role or a characteristic of the Customer class, and its relevance is not explicitly required by the domain.
14. (Optional) Type : This class is tentative because it has broad boundaries and could be a characteristic of other classes.
15. (Optional) Description : This class is tentative because it has broad boundaries and could be a characteristic of other classes.
16. (Optional) Family : This class is tentative because it could be a characteristic of the Customer class.

**Rationale:**

* The classes were retained or merged based on the rules for filtering unsuitable classes:
	+ Redundant classes were merged or removed.
	+ Irrelevant classes were removed.
	+ Vague classes were marked as optional.
	+ Operations (actions/events) were removed.
	+ Implementation constructs were removed or marked as optional.
	+ Derived classes were removed.
	+ Roles were removed or marked as optional.
	+ Attributes were removed or marked as optional.
* The optional classes were identified because they could be characteristics of other classes or their relevance is not explicitly required by the domain.

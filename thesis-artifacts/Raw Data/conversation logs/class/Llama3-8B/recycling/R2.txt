SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

### Next Step: Class Identification using Class Diagrams

We will use class diagrams to identify relationships between the potential classes we've identified.

USER :


    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

### Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes

We will go through the potential classes we identified and filter out the ones that are unsuitable.

#### Redundant Classes:

- **Information**: This is too broad and is already encompassed by **Recycling Center**.
- **Feedback**: This can be included under **User** or **Admin**.
- **Data**: This is too vague and can be included under **Server** or **Database**.
- **Schedule**: This can be included under **User** or **Facility**.

#### Irrelevant Classes:

- **Google Maps**: This is a technical implementation detail and not a part of the real-world domain.
- **Bootstrap**: This is a technical implementation detail and not a part of the real-world domain.
- **UI/UX Lesson**: This is not relevant to the domain.

#### Vague Classes:

- **Environment**: This is too broad and can be included under **Recycling Center** or **Facility**.
- **Server Breach**: This is too specific and can be included under **Server** or **Security**.

#### Operations (Actions/Events):

- **View**: This is an action and not an entity.
- **Update**: This is an action and not an entity.
- **Add**: This is an action and not an entity.
- **Communicate**: This is an action and not an entity.

#### Derived Classes:

- **User Stats**: This can be included under **User** or **Recycling Center**.
- **Facility Stats**: This can be included under **Facility** or **Recycling Center**.

#### Roles:

- **Admin**: This is a role and not an intrinsic identity.
- **Superuser**: This is a role and not an intrinsic identity.

#### Attributes:

- **Zip Code**: This is a descriptive property of an entity and not a standalone class.
- **Email**: This is a descriptive property of an entity and not a standalone class.
- **Recyclable Material**: This is a descriptive property of an entity and not a standalone class.

#### Optional:

- **Device**: This can be included under **User** or **Facility**, but it's not clear if it represents a real-world entity or a technical implementation detail.
- **Notification**: This can be included under **User** or **Facility**, but it's not clear if it represents a real-world entity or an action.

### Filtered Classes:

1. **User**

### Next Step: Class Identification using Class Diagrams

We will use class diagrams to identify relationships between the filtered classes we've identified.

USER :


    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

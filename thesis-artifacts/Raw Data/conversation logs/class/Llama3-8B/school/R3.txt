SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

USER :


    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    

ASSISTANT :

### Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes

#### 1. Redundant Classes
Remove redundant classes by keeping the more specific or descriptive name.

#### 2. Irrelevant Classes
Remove classes with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.

* Dashboard is a technical concept not relevant to the domain. Remove Dashboard.

* Statistics is a general concept not specific to the domain. Remove Statistics.

#### 3. Vague Classes
Remove classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.

* Broadcast Message is a technical concept not specific to the domain. Remove Broadcast Message.

#### 4. Operations (Actions/Events)

#### Optional Classes

* Absence Form: This class is related to student behavior, but its relevance is not clear. It may be included if the system requires tracking absences in a specific way.
* Attendance: This class is related to student performance, but its relevance is not clear. It may be included if the system requires tracking attendance in a specific way.
* Broadcast Message: This class is a technical concept, but its implementation may be necessary for system functionality. It may be included if the system requires sending messages to multiple users.
* Dashboard: This class is a technical concept, but its implementation may be necessary for system functionality. It may be included if the system requires a visual representation of data.
* Schedule: This class is a technical concept, but its implementation may be necessary for system functionality. It may be included if the system requires managing schedules in a specific way.

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2

### Step 3: Present the Final Class List

Here is the final list of classes:

1. DLM
2. Absence Form
3. Attendance
4. Broadcast Message
5. Dashboard
6. Schedule
7. (Optional) Timetable : This class is tentative because its relevance is not clear and it may be inferred from classes that manage classes and schedules.
8. (Optional) Dashboard : This class is tentative because it is a technical concept and its implementation may be necessary for system functionality.
9. (Optional) Broadcast Message : This class is tentative because it is a technical concept and its implementation may be necessary for system functionality.
10. (Optional) Schedule : This class is tentative because it is a technical concept and its implementation may be necessary for system functionality.

Note: Only DLM, Absence Form, Attendance, and Schedule are retained as final classes, while the others are marked as optional due to ambiguity or potential redundancy.

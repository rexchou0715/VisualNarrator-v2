SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

USER :


    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

### Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes

Based on the identified potential classes, we will now filter out the unsuitable classes according to the specified criteria.

#### Redundant Classes

* **Child** and **Guardian** can be merged into a single class, **Child**. The class **Guardian** can be removed as it's redundant.
* **Message** and **Notification** can be merged into a single class, **Notification**. The class **Message** can be removed as it's redundant.

#### Irrelevant Classes

* **Color**, **Size**, etc. are irrelevant attributes and can be removed.
* **School** is a domain-relevant class, but it can be inferred from other classes, so it will be marked as "optional".

#### Vague Classes

* **User** is a vague class as it can include various types of users (student, teacher, administrator, guardian). It will be marked as "optional".
* **Performance data**, **Statistics**, etc. are too broad and can be inferred from other classes. They will be marked as "optional".

#### Operations (Actions/Events)

* **Upload**, **Download**, **Submission**, **Upload confirmation**, etc. are actions/events and can be removed.
* **Change password** can be removed as it's an action/event.
* **Send broadcast message** can be removed as it's an action/event.

#### Implementation Constructs

* **Account details**, **Performance data**, **Statistics**, etc. are implementation constructs and can be removed.
* **Password** is an implementation construct and can be removed.

#### Derived Classes

* **Absence** can be inferred from other classes (e.g., student, teacher, administrator), so it will be marked as "optional".
* **Disciplinary actions** can be inferred from other classes (e.g., student, teacher, administrator), so it will be marked as "optional".

#### Roles

* **Parent** is a role and can be removed.
* **Mentor** is a role and can be removed.

#### Attributes

* **Information** is an attribute and can be removed.

#### Optional Classes

* **School**: Although it's a domain-relevant class, it can be inferred from other classes (e.g., student, teacher, administrator). It's optional.
* **User**: Although it's a domain-relevant class, it's too broad and can be inferred from other classes (e.g., student, teacher, administrator). It's optional.

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

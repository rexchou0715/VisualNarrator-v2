SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    

ASSISTANT :

After re-examining the list, I have filtered out the unsuitable classes as follows:

1. **Orders**:
   - Suitable, represents a key concept in the domain.

2. **Order Status**:
   - Suitable, represents a specific attribute of an order.

3. **Products**:
   - Suitable, represents a key concept in the domain.

4. **Customers**:
   - Suitable, represents a key concept in the domain.

5. **Payment Methods**:
   - Suitable, represents a key concept in the domain.

6. **Coupons**:
   - Suitable, represents a specific type of entity in the domain.

7. **Delivery Orders**:
   - Redundant, can be considered a subset of **Orders**.

8. **Tickets**:
   - Vague, represents an implementation construct rather than a domain concept.

9. **Order Type**:
   - Optional, may be considered a descriptive property of an order rather than a standalone class.

10. **Kitchen Employees**, **Ticket Masters**, **Cashiers**, **Restaurant Owners**, and **Home Delivery Persons**:
    - Roles, as they primarily describe job responsibilities rather than entities with inherent characteristics.

11. **Cashier Accounts**:
    - Derived, can be inferred from the **Cashiers** class.

12. **Tips**:
    - Actions/Events, represents an action or event rather than an entity.

13. **Tips** (second instance):
    - Optional, may be considered a descriptive property of an order rather than a standalone class.

14. **VAT**:
    - Attributes, may be considered a descriptive property of an order rather than a standalone class.

The updated list of suitable classes is:

1. **Orders**
2. **Order Status**
3. **Products**
4. **Customers**
5. **Payment Methods**
6. **Coupons**
7. **Order Type** (optional)
8. **Cashiers** (optional)
9. **Restaurant Owners** (optional)

The following classes are retained as optional due to ambiguity or potential overlap with other classes:

1. **Order Type**
2. **Cashiers**
3. **Restaurant Owners**

USER :


    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

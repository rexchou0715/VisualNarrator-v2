SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

18. (Optional) VAT : This class is tentative because it can be inferred from Orders and Payments, but it may still be useful to track VAT separately.
19. (Optional) Tips : This class is tentative because it can be included under Payments, but it may still be useful to track tips separately.
20. (Optional) Navigation Systems : This class is tentative because it can be included under Tickets, but it may still be useful to track navigation systems separately.

I have removed the following classes because they were redundant, irrelevant, vague, operations, implementation constructs, derived, roles, or attributes:

* Tickets (redundant with Receipts)
* Coupons (redundant with Payments)
* Receipts (redundant with Payments)
* Navigation Systems (vague and redundant with Tickets)
* Screen (irrelevant, system-level concept)
* Phone (irrelevant, system-level concept)
* Products Sold (derived from Orders and Products)
* Inventory (derived from Orders and Products)

I have retained the following classes because they are key concepts in the domain, or because they cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable:

* Orders
* Products
* Kitchen
* Customers
* Cashiers
* Restaurant Owners
* Home Delivery Persons
* Payments
* Payment Methods
* Order Status
* Product Status
* Order Types
* Receipts
* Delivery Areas

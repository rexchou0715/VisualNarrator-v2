    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

### Step 1: Identify Potential Classes

To identify potential classes, we need to extract nouns or compound nouns from the given user stories.

1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns):
   - Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
   - Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.

2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.

3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

Here's the list of potential classes identified from the user stories:

#### Orders and Order Management

- **Order**: Represents a customer's order.
- **Product**: Represents a food item or dish.
- **Order Status**: Represents the status of an order (e.g., incoming, current, finished, scheduled).
- **Ticket**: Represents a printed or digital receipt for a customer.

#### User Roles

- **Kitchen Employee**: Represents a staff member working in the kitchen.
- **Ticket Master**: Represents a staff member responsible for managing orders.
- **Cashier**: Represents a staff member responsible for handling customer payments.
- **Customer**: Represents the end-user purchasing food.
- **Home Delivery Person**: Represents a staff member responsible for delivering food to customers.
- **Restaurant Owner**: Represents the business owner of the restaurant.

#### Other

- **Payment Method**: Represents the different ways a customer can pay for their order (e.g., cash, card, online).
- **Coupon**: Represents a discount or promotion offered to customers.
- **Tip**: Represents an optional additional payment made by customers.
- **Delivery Address**: Represents the location where food is delivered.
- **Phone Number**: Represents the contact information for customers or staff members.

### Potential Class Relationships

Based on the user stories, the following relationships can be identified:

- An **Order** is associated with multiple **Products**.
- An **Order** has a specific **Status** (e.g., incoming, current, finished, scheduled).
- A **Kitchen Employee**, **Ticket Master**, **Cashier**, and **Home Delivery Person** are all involved in managing **Orders**.
- A **Customer** places an **Order** and receives a **Ticket**.
- A **Restaurant Owner** manages **Orders**, **Payments**, and **Tips**.

These relationships will help refine the class structure and ensure that the system meets the requirements outlined in the user stories.

USER :


    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

### Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes

Based on the user stories, we will filter out the classes that do not genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts.

#### Redundant Classes

- **Status** (e.g., incoming, current, finished, scheduled): Combine into a single class, **OrderStatus**, as **Status** is too generic and can be inferred from the specific types of status mentioned.
- **Ticket** (printed or digital): Keep as it is a distinct concept in the domain.
- **Payment Method**: Remove as it can be inferred from the context of payment.

#### Irrelevant Classes

- **Phone Number**: Remove as it's an attribute of a customer or staff member rather than a standalone class.
- **Coupon**: Remove as it's an implementation construct (a specific type of discount) and not a distinct entity in the domain.
- **Tip**: Remove as it's an attribute of an order rather than a standalone class.
- **Delivery Address**: Remove as it's an attribute of an order rather than a standalone class.

#### Vague Classes

- **Product**: Keep as it's a specific concept in the domain.
- **Order**: Keep as it's a specific concept in the domain.
- **Order Number**: Remove as it's an attribute of an order rather than a standalone class.
- **Customer Name**: Remove as it's an attribute of a customer rather than a standalone class.

#### Operations (Actions/Events)

- **Place Order**: Remove as it's an action rather than an entity.
- **Start Preparation**: Remove as it's an action rather than an entity.
- **Finish Preparation**: Remove as it's an action rather than an entity.
- **Receive Payment**: Remove as it's an action rather than an entity.
- **Activate Coupon**: Remove as it's an action rather than an entity.

#### Implementation Constructs

- **Cashier Accounts**: Remove as it's a technical implementation construct rather than a real-world entity.
- **Number of Tips**: Remove as it's a technical implementation construct rather than a real-world entity.

#### Derived Classes

- **Restaurant Owner**: Remove as it can be inferred from the context of the business.
- **Home Delivery Person**: Remove as it can be inferred from the context of the delivery service.

#### Roles

- **Ticket Master**: Remove as it's a role rather than an intrinsic identity.
- **Cashier**: Remove as it's a role rather than an intrinsic identity.
- **Kitchen Employee**: Remove as it's a role rather than an intrinsic identity.
- **Customer**: Remove as it's a role rather than an intrinsic identity.

#### Attributes

- **Order Price**: Remove as it's an attribute of an order rather than a standalone class.
- **Order Type**: Remove as it's an attribute of an order rather than a standalone class.

The filtered list of classes is:

- **Order**
- **Product**
- **OrderStatus**
- **Ticket**
- **Customer**
- **Home Delivery Person**
- **Restaurant**

Optional classes:

- **Payment Method**: Could be included as a specific type of payment method (e.g., credit card, cash).
- **Coupon**: Could be included as a specific type of discount.
- **Tip**: Could be included as an attribute of an order.
- **Delivery Address**: Could be included as an attribute of an order.

- **Kitchen Employee**: Could be included as a specific role within the restaurant.
- **Customer**: Could be included as a specific type of customer (e.g., dine-in, take-out).
- **Order Price**: Could be included as an attribute of an order.
- **Order Type**: Could be included as an attribute of an order.

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

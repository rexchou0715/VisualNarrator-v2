    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

**Filtering Unsuitable Classes**

### Redundant Classes

1. **Removed "Ticket"**: The concept of a ticket is already covered by the more specific classes "Physical Ticket" and "Digital Ticket".
2. **Removed "Order Screen"**: The concept of an order screen is already covered by the more specific classes "Order" and "Ticket".

1. **Removed "Navigation System"**: Although the navigation system is used by the delivery person, it is not a relevant concept in the domain of the restaurant or kitchen.
2. **Removed "Phone Number"**: Although phone numbers are mentioned in the user stories, they are not a relevant concept in the domain of the restaurant or kitchen.

### Vague Classes

1. **Removed "Employees"**: The concept of employees is too broad and does not provide any specific information about the domain.

### Optional Classes

1. **Customer's Name**: Although this concept is not a standalone class, it is an important attribute of the Customer class and may be worth considering as a separate class.
2. **Order Details**: Although this concept is not a standalone class, it is an important attribute of the Order class and may be worth considering as a separate class.

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:

These classes have been refined based on the rules for filtering unsuitable classes:

* Redundant classes were removed (e.g., "Ticket" was removed because it is already covered by "Physical Ticket" and "Digital Ticket").
* Irrelevant classes were removed (e.g., "Navigation System" was removed because it is not a relevant concept in the domain of the restaurant or kitchen).
* Vague classes were removed (e.g., "Employees" was removed because it is too broad and does not provide any specific information about the domain).
* Operations (actions/events) were removed (e.g., "Changes" was removed because it is an action and not an entity).
* Implementation constructs were removed (e.g., "Login Information" was removed because it is a technical concept and not part of the real-world domain).
* Derived classes were removed (e.g., "Types of Orders" was removed because it can be entirely inferred from the more specific classes "Takeaway Order" and "Home Delivery Order").
* Roles were removed (e.g., "Role" was removed because it is only indicating a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity).
* Attributes were removed (e.g., "Description" was removed because it is a descriptive property of an entity and not a standalone class).

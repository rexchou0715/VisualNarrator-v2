SYSTEM :


    You are an expert in Requirements Engineering specializing in class identification from user stories.
    I will provide you with a set of user stories. You will follow the following steps.
     
    Step 1: Identify Potential Classes
    1. Extract Nouns (or Compound Nouns): List all nouns mentioned in the user stories. These can include:
       o Physical entities: e.g., houses, persons, machines.
       o Conceptual entities: e.g., trajectories, seating assignments, payment schedules.
    2. Ignore Subclasses: When defining classes, do not consider any subclasses. Focus on the ânouns or compound nounsâ themselves.
    3. Exclude Overly Generic Terms: Remove terms like âthing,â âitem,â or similarly vague words.

    Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes
    Remove the following types of classes, retaining only those that genuinely represent domain-relevant concepts:
    o Redundant Classes: If two classes refer to the same concept, keep the more specific or descriptive name.
    o Irrelevant Classes: Any class with little to no relevance to the domain in the user stories.
    o Vague Classes: Classes whose boundaries are too broad or ambiguous to serve as a discrete entity.
    o Operations (Actions/Events): If the noun represents an action or event rather than an entity, exclude it (unless explicitly required by the domain).
    o Implementation Constructs: Technical or system-level concepts not part of the real-world domain.
    o Derived Classes: Classes that can be entirely inferred from other classes.
    o Roles: Classes that only indicate a relationship role rather than an intrinsic identity.
    o Attributes: Descriptive properties of an entity (e.g., color, size) should not be treated as standalone classes.
    If a noun cannot be clearly classified as suitable or unsuitable, mark it as "optional" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.

**Step 2: Filter Unsuitable Classes**

### Remove Redundant Classes

* Removed "Order Type" as it is a subset of the "Order" class.
* Removed "Revenue" as it is a subset of the "Price" class.
* Removed "Address" as it is a subset of the "Customer" class.

### Remove Irrelevant Classes

* Removed "Navigation System" as it is an implementation construct.
* Removed "Employee" as it is a role and can be inferred from the "Cashier", "Ticket Master", and "Home Delivery Person" classes.

### Remove Vague Classes

* Removed "Products" as it is too broad and can be inferred from the "Product" class.
* Removed "Inventory" as it is too vague and can be inferred from the "Product" and "Order" classes.

### Remove Operations (Actions/Events)

* Removed "Payment" as it is an action/event.
* Removed "Delivery" as it is an action/event.
* Removed "Processing" as it is an action/event.
* Removed "Activation" as it is an action/event.

### Remove Implementation Constructs

* Removed "Ticket" as it is an implementation construct.

### Remove Derived Classes

* Removed "Shift" as it can be inferred from the "Cashier" class.

### Remove Roles

* Removed "Delivery Person" as it is a role and can be inferred from the "Home Delivery Person" class.

### Remove Attributes

* Removed "Price" as it is a descriptive property of an entity.
* Removed "Phone Number" as it is a descriptive property of an entity.

### Remaining Classes

1. Order
2. Status
3. Product
4. Customer
5. Cashier
6. Ticket Master
7. Restaurant Owner
8. Home Delivery Person
9. VAT
10. Coupon
11. Tip
12. Employee
13. Order Details

### Optional Classes

1. Revenue - This can be either a suitable class or a derived class, depending on whether it is a distinct concept from the "Price" class.
2. Products - This can be either a suitable class or a vague class, depending on whether it is a distinct concept from the "Product" class.
3. Inventory - This can be either a suitable class or a vague class, depending on whether it is a distinct concept from the "Product" and "Order" classes.
4. Navigation System - This can be either a suitable class or an implementation construct, depending on whether it is a part of the real-world domain.

Note: The classification of classes as suitable or unsuitable may vary depending on the specific requirements and context of the system.

    Step 3: Present the Final Class List
    1. Structured Format: Provide the refined list of class candidates in a concise format (e.g., [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]).
    2. Always Explain Your Rationale: Briefly justify why each class was retained, referencing the rules from above. If you removed or merged certain nouns, clarify which rule applied.
    3. Mark Optional Classes: If a noun cannot be definitively classified as suitable or unsuitable, prefix it with "(optional)" and provide an explanation for why it may or may not be included.
    
    Please follow the output format strictly:
        
    Here is the final list of classes:
    1. Class1
    2. Class2
    3. (Optional) Class3 : This class is tentative because [brief explanation of the ambiguity]

12. (Optional) Revenue : This class is tentative because it may be a derived class from the "Price" class, but further analysis is needed to confirm its distinctiveness.
13. (Optional) Products : This class is tentative because it may be too vague or a subset of the "Product" class, but its relevance to the domain needs further clarification.
14. (Optional) Inventory : This class is tentative because it may be too vague or a subset of the "Product" and "Order" classes, but its distinctiveness needs further analysis.

The following classes were removed because they were:

* Redundant Classes: Order Type, Revenue, Price, Phone Number, and Ticket were removed because they were subsets or descriptive properties of other classes.
* Irrelevant Classes: Navigation System and Employee were removed because they were implementation constructs or roles.
* Vague Classes: Products and Inventory were removed because they were too broad or ambiguous.
* Operations (Actions/Events): Payment, Delivery, Processing, and Activation were removed because they were actions or events.
* Implementation Constructs: Ticket was removed because it was an implementation construct.
* Derived Classes: Shift was removed because it could be inferred from the Cashier class.
* Roles: Delivery Person was removed because it was a role and could be inferred from the Home Delivery Person class.

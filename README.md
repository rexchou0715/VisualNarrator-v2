# Hi everyone! 👋  
This repository contains an artifact I'm currently developing as part of my master’s thesis, supervised by Fabiano Dalpiaz. The system is still a work in progress, and the dataset has not been published yet.

## 🧪 Thesis Topic  
The main goal of this project is to compare the performance of selected small language models (SLMs), **GPT-o1**, and a rule-based system called **Visual Narrator**, which was developed by a previous researcher.

## ⚙️ What the System Does  
The system takes a set of conversation logs generated by these models, extracts relevant information (such as **classes** and **associations**), and then automatically compares the extracted results against a gold standard. The evaluation uses **F-0.5** and **F-2** scores as the main performance metrics.

## 📊 Where to Start  
While detailed instructions on how to run the system are coming soon, you can already check out the **`statistical_analysis`** folder. There, you’ll find:

- Statistical test results  
- Multiple box plots comparing performance and variability across models

Stay tuned for more updates!
